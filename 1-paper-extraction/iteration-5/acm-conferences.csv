While the problem has been faced with centralized approaches assuming knowledge of the available underlying infrastructure resources, this paper introduces a distributed task allocation framework emphasizing energy awareness without requiring infrastructure knowledge. The framework is designed to optimize energy consumption in heterogeneous computing environments, leveraging a distributed consensus algorithm that allows nodes to maximize individual or global goals. Each private custom utility function enables a node to carefully determine whether executing a task is efficient, thus ensuring flexibility in the task allocation process based on local preferences. While showcasing the energy efficiency of our framework, we also illustrate that it is not necessary to disclose the underlying infrastructure resources status, ensuring the preservation of potentially sensitive local resources information. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's ability to achieve optimal power consumption outcomes while maintaining privacy, offering a significant advancement over traditional centralized allocation policies and Kubernetes-like scheduling algorithms.","2024","2025-03-14 16:04:47","2025-03-14 16:04:47","","28–34","","","","","","","MECC '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Athens, Greece","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To reduce energy-related costs and improve environmental sustainability, most modern data centers consolidate Virtual Machine (VM) workloads belonging to different application classes, some being latency-critical (LC) and others being more tolerant to performance changes, known as best-effort (BE). However, in public cloud scenarios, the real classes of applications are often opaque to data center operators. The heterogeneous applications from different cloud tenants are usually consolidated onto the same hosts to improve energy efficiency, but it is not trivial to guarantee decent performance isolation among colocated workloads. We tackle the above challenges by introducing Demeter, a QoS-aware power management controller for heterogeneous black-box workloads in public clouds. Demeter is designed to work without offline profiling or prior knowledge about black-box workloads. Through the correlation analysis between network throughput and CPU resource utilization, Demeter automatically classifies black-box workloads as either LC or BE. By provisioning differentiated CPU management strategies (including dynamic core allocation and frequency scaling) to LC and BE workloads, Demeter achieves considerable power savings together with a minimum impact on the performance of all workloads. We discuss the design and implementation of Demeter in this work, and conduct extensive experimental evaluations to reveal its effectiveness. Our results show that Demeter not only meets the performance demand of all workloads, but also responds quickly to dynamic load changes in our cloud environment. In addition, Demeter saves an average of 10.6% power consumption than state of the art mechanisms.","2022","2025-03-14 16:04:47","2025-03-14 16:04:47","","31–46","","","","","","","SoCC '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: San Francisco, California","","","","cloud computing; power management; quality of service; workload characterization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the interest of programmer productivity and ease of scaling, workloads in data centers have shifted from single monolithic processes toward a micro and nanoservice software architecture. As a result, single servers are now packed with many threads executing the same, relatively small task on different data.State-of-the-art data centers run these microservices on multi-core CPUs. However, the flexibility offered by traditional CPUs comes at an energy-efficiency cost. The Multiple Instruction Multiple Data execution model misses opportunities to aggregate the similarity in contemporary microservices. We observe that the Single Instruction Multiple Thread execution model, employed by GPUs, provides better thread scaling and has the potential to reduce frontend and memory system energy consumption. However, contemporary GPUs are ill-suited for the latency-sensitive microservice space.To exploit the similarity in contemporary microservices, while maintaining acceptable latency, we propose the Request Processing Unit (RPU). The RPU combines elements of out-of-order CPUs with lockstep thread aggregation mechanisms found in GPUs to execute microservices in a Single Instruction Multiple Request (SIMR) fashion. To complement the RPU, we also propose a SIMR-aware software stack that uses novel mechanisms to batch requests based on their predicted control-flow, split batches based on predicted latency divergence and map per-request memory allocations to maximize coalescing opportunities. Our resulting RPU system processes 5.7× more requests/joule than multi-core CPUs, while increasing single thread latency by only 1.44×.","2023","2025-03-14 16:04:47","2025-03-14 16:04:47","","441–463","","","","","","","MICRO '22","","","","IEEE Press","Chicago, Illinois, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","data center; GPU; microservices; SIMT","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To facilitate such optimizations, we present Carbon Containers, a simple system-level facility, which extends prior work on power containers, that automatically regulates applications' carbon emissions in response to variations in both their work-load's intensity and their energy's carbon-intensity. Specifically, Carbon Containers enable applications to specify a maximum carbon emissions rate (in g.CO2e/hr), and then transparently enforce this rate via a combination of vertical scaling, container migration, and suspend/resume while maximizing either energy-efficiency or performance.Carbon Containers are especially useful for applications that i) must continue running even during high-carbon periods, and ii) execute in regions with few variations in carbon-intensity. These low-variability regions also tend to have high average carbon-intensity, which increases the importance of regulating carbon emissions. We implement a Carbon Container prototype by extending Linux Containers to incorporate the mechanisms above and evaluate it using real workload traces and carbon-intensity data from multiple regions. We compare Carbon Containers with prior work that regulates carbon emissions by suspending/resuming applications during high/low carbon periods. We show that Carbon Containers are more carbon-efficient and improve performance while maintaining similar carbon emissions.","2023","2025-03-14 16:04:47","2025-03-14 16:04:47","","17–31","","","","","","","SoCC '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Santa Cruz, CA, USA","","","","Carbon-efficiency; energy-efficiency; performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We introduce ANT-Man, an Auto, Native and Transparent power Management framework that can exploit fine-grained microservice variability for system efficiency. To achieve this, ANT-Man abstracts away two major sources of latency overhead in traditional hierarchical power management frameworks. First, ANT-Man proposes an auto power budgeting scheme for reducing the power coordination latency at the datacenter level. It can proactively determine the power budget tailored to each individual microservice. Second, ANT-Man proposes a native and transparent power control scheme to overcome the power configuration latency for each microservice.

Their wide resource distribution enables MECs to fulfill the need of low latency and high bandwidth to offer an improved user experience.As modern cloud applications are increasingly architected as collections of small, independently deployable services, they can be flexibly deployed in various configurations that combines resources from both centralized datacenters and edge locations. In principle, such applications should therefore be well-placed to exploit the advantages of MECs so as to reduce service response times.In this paper, we quantify the benefits of deploying such cloud micro-service applications on MECs. Using two popular benchmarks, we show that, against conventional wisdom, end-to-end latency does not improve significantly even when most application services are deployed in the edge location. We developed a profiler to better understand this phenomenon, allowing us to develop recommendations for adapting applications to MECs. Further, by quantifying the gains of those recommendations, we show that the performance of an application can be made to reach the ideal scenario, in which the latency between an edge datacenter and a remote datacenter has no impact on the application performance.This work thus presents ways of adapting cloud-native applications to take advantage of MECs and provides guidance for developing MEC-native applications.

Its role in DSO is critical in providing feedback loops on system performance leading to desirable changes achieving long-term system and application sustainment. Containers are the de-facto deployed artifacts in DSO for diverse forms of systems and applications including AI models. Long-term sustainment of containerized AI models requires appropriate metrics for the successful maintenance of optimal container and model computing performance and correct model inference. There is no agreed upon set of metrics that should always be present when monitoring a deployed containerized AI model. The current literature and practice can benefit from a standard baseline of metrics for long-term monitoring of containerized AI models focused on computing and inference. In this paper, we propose a candidate baseline of metrics for consideration as a standard across PDM for any containerized AI model. We present a proof-of-concept (PoC) that implements a baseline of metrics for the continuous monitoring of an operationally deployed containerized AI model. The baseline represents the minimal metrics required for any containerized model deployed and actively operating to ensure successful long-term monitoring and support of optimal operation and performance. The metrics focus on container operation, model operation, and model inference. This paper also details the raw data required for the metrics along with a PoC which demonstrates container engineering for their acquisition. The paper illustrates the baseline as a mix of dynamic metrics that are customized for each problem class (e.g., object detection, regression) and data modality together with static metrics that should be present for any containerized model. The paper further shows that a containerized AI model can be engineered to produce these metrics and describes the benefits of a standardized baseline of metrics to aid in the reduction of power consumption in the global digital enterprise.","2024","2025-03-14 16:04:47","2025-03-14 16:04:47","","46–55","","","","","","","ICSSP '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: M\, Germany","","","","AI; Artificial Intelligence; Container; Continuous Deployment; Deployment; DevOps; DevSecOps.; Machine Learning; Metrics; ML; Performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite accelerating microservice diversity, there is a strong requirement to limit diversity in underlying server hardware to maintain hardware resource fungibility, preserve procurement economies of scale, and curb qualification/test overheads. As such, there is an urgent need for strategies that enable limited server CPU architectures (a.k.a ""SKUs"") to provide performance and energy efficiency over diverse microservices. To this end, we first undertake a comprehensive characterization of the top seven microservices that run on the compute-optimized data center fleet at Facebook.Our characterization reveals profound diversity in OS and I/O interaction, cache misses, memory bandwidth utilization, instruction mix, and CPU stall behavior. Whereas customizing a CPU SKU for each microservice might be beneficial, it is prohibitive. Instead, we argue for ""soft SKUs"", wherein we exploit coarse-grain (e.g., boot time) configuration knobs to tune the platform for a particular microservice. We develop a tool, μSKU, that automates search over a soft-SKU design space using A/B testing in production and demonstrate how it can obtain statistically significant gains (up to 7.2% and 4.5% performance improvement over stock and production servers, respectively) with no additional hardware requirements.","2019","2025-03-14 16:04:47","2025-03-14 16:04:47","","513–526","","","","","","","ISCA '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Phoenix, Arizona","","","","microservice; resource fungibility; soft SKU","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A problem that emerges from these scenarios is that both the data that circulates through sensor ecosystems, as well as that which is temporarily stored by these sensors, may eventually be subject to intervention by malicious users, generating: (1) a negative impact on the privacy, integrity and confidentiality of user and system data; and (2) compromise the security of the sensor nodes to execute malicious actions on a physical or digital environment, impacting on the safety of people, and economically on companies and communities. In this article, we introduce a pattern for the architectural design of a secure sensor node that characterizes the problem and helps architects solve it using a reusable, adaptable, and extensible solution.

Generally, mesh networking technologies are used for building such systems since mesh networks provide the best performance characteristics regarding fault-tolerance, throughput, resource usage, and service level flexibility.In this paper, we summarize the major challenges in dependable network design, to subsequently present three patterns that approach redundancy on the hardware level, software-defined networking, and cross-cutting concerns like monitoring and service discovery within distributed networked systems. These three patterns should help designers and engineers in choosing the appropriate technologies for building dependable networked systems at all scales.

Finding well suited granularities in terms of the architectural capabilities of endpoints and the read-write semantics of their operations are particularly important design concerns. Existing pattern languages have dealt with local APIs in object-oriented programming, with remote objects, with queue-based messaging and with service-oriented computing platforms.

However, traditional management focuses on the sensors’ parameters and interfaces without highlighting the perception effect that is users’ concern and dynamic changing. It also lacks a unified management approach for heterogeneous sensors. To overcome the limitations, we propose a novel heterogeneous sensors dynamic management model UbiCap, i.e., Ubiquitous Capability, which is based on the capability abstraction and adaptive run-time capability management mechanism. The capability provides a unified abstract for heterogeneous sensors. The adaptive run-time capability management mechanism transfers the management object from low-level hardware sensors to high-level sensing capability. The capability required and the available capability are matched to support run-time adaptive sensors selection. We implement a software prototype iS2ROS(intelligent Sensor Selection Robot Operating System) based on the UbiCap model. We then simulate a forest fire spot monitoring scenario where iS2ROS selects the optimal image sensor during the identification task execution while light or weather condition changes.

Although traditional data center power optimization frameworks excel at per-server or per-rack management, they can hardly make informed decisions when facing microservices that have different QoS requirements on a per-service basis. In a power-constrained data center, blindly budgeting power usage could lead to a power unbalance issue: microservices on the critical path may not receive adequate power budget. This unavoidably hinders the growth of cloud productivity.To unleash the performance potential of cloud in the microservice era, this paper investigates microservice-aware data center resource management. We model microservice using a bipartite graph and propose a metric called microservice criticality factor (MCF) to measure the overall impact of performance scaling on a microservice from the whole application's perspective. We further devise ServiceFridge, a novel system framework that leverages MCF to jointly orchestrate software containers and control hardware power demand.

The latter is a safety critical IoT system based on collecting and analyzing the real-time data to perform proper actuation. In order to engineer such a high quality IoT application, a proper software architecture should be designed. In order for the software architecture to be able to optimize critical requirements such as fault-tolerance, performance and energy consumption, it ought to: i) adapt itself to real-time environment transformation, ii) be designed in a proper level of elements distribution. In this paper, we critically analyze a set of IoT distribution and self-adaptation patterns to identify their suitable architectural combinations. Further, we use our IoT modeling framework (CAPS) to model an emergency handling system. Based on these, we design two quality driven architectures to be used for a forest monitoring and evacuation example and qualitatively evaluate and compare them.","2018","2025-03-14 16:04:47","2025-03-14 16:04:47","","","","","","","","","ECSA '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Madrid, Spain","","","","self-adaptation; IoT; architectural patterns and styles; quality attributes; urban security","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Power is one of the most constrained and difficult to manage resources in datacenters. Accurate accounting of power usage across clients of multi-tenant web services can improve budgeting, planning and provisioning of compute resources. In this work, we propose a queuing theory based transitive power modeling framework that estimates the total power cost of a client request across the stack of shared services running in Facebook datacenters. By capturing the non-linearity of power vs load relation, our model is able to estimate marginal change in power consumption of a system upon serving a request with a mean error of less than 4% when applied on production services. In view of the fact that datacenter capacity is planned for peak demand, we test this model at peak load to report up to 2x improvement in accuracy compared to a mathematical model. We further leverage this framework along with a distributed tracing system to estimate power demand shift for serving particular product features within fraction of a percentage and guide the decision to shift their computation at off-peak time.","2021","2025-03-14 16:04:47","2025-03-14 16:04:47","","182–191","","","","","","","WWW '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Ljubljana, Slovenia","","","","cpu; power; scalability; time shifting; transitive; utilization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To investigate the tradeoff, we propose performability models for evaluating services hosted in software-defined networks with a time-based MTD mechanism being deployed. We developed analytical models for evaluating key performability metrics, in terms of response time, throughput, availability, host utilization, a number of requests lost, and cost (i.e., energy consumption plus profits lost due to dropped jobs). Our results showed that using the time-based MTD mechanism can (1) improve service response time and host utilization; (2) introduce a higher number of requests lost and higher overall cost; and (3) reduce service availability while still handling most of the jobs without much performance degradation.","2020","2025-03-14 16:04:47","2025-03-14 16:04:47","","1180–1189","","","","","","","SAC '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Brno, Czech Republic","","","","moving target defense; performability; petri nets; software-defined networking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We use this metric to redefine device service lifetime in terms of carbon efficiency. We develop a cloudlet of reused Pixel 3A phones.

They deliver greater connectivity, tremendous savings, and lower total cost of ownership. Despite such benefits and benchmarking advances, costs are still quite unpredictable, performance is unclear, security is inconsistent, and there is minimal control over aspects like data and service locality. Estimating performance of cloud environments is very hard for cloud consumers. They would like to make informed decisions about which provider better suits their needs using specialized evaluation mechanisms. Providers have their own tools reporting specific metrics, but they are potentially biased and often incomparable across providers. Current benchmarking tools allow comparison but consumers need more flexibility to evaluate environments under actual operating conditions for specialized applications. Ours is early stage work and a step towards a monitoring solution that enables independent evaluation of clouds for very specific application needs. In this paper, we present our initial architecture of the Cloud Monitor that aims to integrate existing and new benchmarks in a flexible and extensible way. By way of a simplistic demonstrator, we illustrate the concept. We report some preliminary monitoring results after a brief time of monitoring and are able to observe unexpected anomalies.

In this paper we highlight the architectural weakness of a centralized controller in O-RAN by first drawing parallels with the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) controller. We then present a two part security evaluation of two open-source Near-RT RICs (μONOS and OSC), focused on the newly introduced A1 interface of the Near-RT RIC. In the first part of our evaluation, we evaluate the supply-chain risks of μONOS and OSC using off-the-shelf open-source dependency analysis and configuration file analysis tools. In the second part, we present our run-time security testing of the A1 API implemented by μONOS and OSC using our custom O-RAN A1 Interface Testing Tool (OAITT). Our supply-chain risk analysis shows that both the open-source Near-RT RICs we evaluated have multiple dependency risks and weak or insecure configurations. We identified 211 and 285 known dependency vulnerabilities in μONOS and OSC respectively of which 82 and 190 dependencies were rated as high CVSS respectively. The A1 interface contributed to a majority of the dependency risks in both Near-RT RICs. From a security misconfiguration perspective, we identified issues concerning access control, lack of encryption and poor secret management. Our run-time testing of OSC and μONOS revealed the following. First, both Near-RT RICs lack TLS for the A1 interface. Second, malicious Non-Real Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Non-RT RIC)s or rApps that reside in the Non-RT RIC could tamper with policies installed in the Near-RT RIC which can impact the availability of the O-RAN. Third, the A1 protocol could be exploited by Non-RT RICs for covert communication via the Near-RT RIC. Fourth, the A1 implementation by μONOS was vulnerable to degradation of service attacks (10-60s response time for GET requests) and a denial of service attack, the latter has been ethically reported and a fix is underway.","2024","2025-03-14 16:04:48","2025-03-14 16:04:48","","277–287","","","","","","","WiSec '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Seoul, Republic of Korea","","","","near-real time ric; o-ran; security testing; software security","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For addressing these challenges, hybridizing EAs with other algorithms and methods and parallelizing them in cluster computing environments represent essential solutions. In the present paper, a new software solution for supporting the hybridizations of parallel EAs is proposed. Unlike other software solutions for hybridizing EAs, the proposed software solution provides a flexible, generic and scalable mechanism for integrating any algorithmic approach like a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm to seed the initial population of parallel EAs. It is designed based on three modern software technologies, namely microservices, container virtualization and the publish/subscribe messaging paradigm. The applicability and generality of the presented software solution is tested by hybridizing the General Learning Evolutionary Algorithm and Method (GLEAM) with ML techniques for solving the problem of scheduling Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). The benchmarking tests are performed in a cluster computing environment. The obtained results show that the new software solution represents a successful approach to facilitate the hybridization of parallel EAs paving the road for future applications of EAs in several domains.","2022","2025-03-14 16:04:48","2025-03-14 16:04:48","","2001–2008","","","","","","","GECCO '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Boston, Massachusetts","","","","microservice; scalability; container; global model; hybrid evolutionary algorithms; parallel computing; parallel evolutionary algorithms; scheduling distributed energy resources; virtualization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the lack of both relevant datasets andpre-trained DNN models, coupled with resource limitations in wild environments, hinders the effective deployment and continuous operation of live sonar analytics.We present SALINA, a sustainable live sonar analytics system designed to address these challenges. SALINA enables real-time processing of acoustic sonar data with spatial and temporal adaptations, and features energy-efficient operation through a robust energy management module. Deployed for six months at two inland rivers in British Columbia, Canada, SALINA provided continuous 24/7 underwater monitoring, supporting fishery stewardship and wildlife restoration efforts. Through extensive real-world testing, SALINA demonstrated an up to 9.5% improvement in average precision and a 10.1% increase in tracking metrics.

An example is a web application hosted across multiple cloud regions, each with varying carbon intensity based on their local electricity mix. Distributed load-balancing enables the exploitation of low-carbon energy through load migration across regions, reducing web applications carbon footprint. In this paper, we present CASPER, a carbon-aware scheduling and provisioning system that primarily minimizes the carbon footprint of distributed web services while also respecting their Service Level Objectives (SLO). We formulate CASPER as an multi-objective optimization problem that considers both the variable carbon intensity and latency constraints of the network.

Specifically, we identify key bottlenecks to software-driven cloud carbon reduction, including (1) the lack of visibility and disaggregated control between cloud providers and users over infrastructure and applications, (2) the immense overhead presently incurred by application developers to implement carbon-aware application optimizations, and (3) the increasing complexity of carbon-aware resource management due to renewable energy variability and growing hardware heterogeneity. To overcome these barriers, we propose an agile approach that federates the responsibility and tools to achieve carbon awareness across different cloud stakeholders. As a key first step, we advocate leveraging the role of application operators in managing large-scale cloud deployments and integrating carbon efficiency metrics into their cloud usage workflow. We discuss various techniques to help operators reduce carbon emissions, such as carbon budgets, service-level visibility into emissions, and configurable-yet-centralized resource management optimizations.","2023","2025-03-14 16:04:48","2025-03-14 16:04:48","","","","","","","","","HotCarbon '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Boston, MA, USA","","","","cloud computing; sustainability; carbon reduction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, in this work, we propose a deep-learning-based approach for identifying the presence of two containers colluding to covertly leak secret information. In more detail, we consider a threat actor trying to exfiltrate a 4,096-bit private TLS key via five different covert channels. To decide whether containers are colluding for leaking data, the deep learning model is fed with statistical indicators of the syscalls, which are built starting from simple counters.

This document is mostly dedicated to the 2024 fall cycle but also provides some statistics summarizing all three cycles.We introduced several notable changes to ASPLOS this year, most of which were discussed in our previous messages from program chairs in Volume 1 and 2, including: (1) significantly increasing the program committee size to over 220 members (more than twice the size of last year); (2) foregoing synchronous program committee (PC) meetings and instead making all decisions online; (3) overhauling the review assignment process; (4) developing an automated submission format violation identifier script that uncovers, e.g., disallowed vertical space manipulations that ""squeeze"" space; (5) introducing the new ASPLOS role of Program Vice Chairs to cope with the increased number of submissions and the added load caused by foregoing synchronous program committee; and (6) characterizing a systematic problem that ASPLOS is facing in reviewing quantum computing submissions, describing how we addressed it and highlighting how we believe that it should be handled in the future.Assuming readers have read our previous messages, here, we will only describe differences between the current cycle and the previous ones. These include: (1) Finally unifying submission and acceptance paper formatting instructions (forgoing the `jpaper' class) to rid authors of accepted papers from the need to reformat; (2) Describing the methodology we employed to select best papers, which we believe ensures quality and hope will persist; and (3) Reporting the ethical incidents we encountered and how we handled them. In the final, fourth volume, when the outcome of the ASPLOS'24 fall major revisions will become known, we plan to conduct a broader analysis of all the data we have gathered throughout the year.Following are some key statistics of the fall cycle: 340 submissions were finalized (43% more than last year's fall count and 17% less than our summer cycle) of which 111 are related to accelerators/FPGAs/GPUs, 105 to machine learning, 54 to security, 50 to datacenter/cloud and 50 to storage/memory; 183 (54%) submissions were promoted to the second review round; 39 (11.5%) papers were accepted (of which 19 were awarded artifact evaluation badges); 33 (9.7%) submissions were allowed to submit major revisions and are currently under review (these will be addressed in the fourth volume of ASPLOS'24 and will be presented in ASPLOS'25 if accepted); 1,368 reviews were uploaded; and 4,949 comments were generated during online discussions, of which 4,070 were dedicated to the submissions that made it to the second review round.This year, in the submission form, we asked authors to specify which of the three ASPLOS research areas are related to their submitted work. Analyzing this data revealed that 80%, 39%, and 29% of the submissions are categorized by their authors as related to architecture, operating systems, and programming languages, respectively, generating the highest difference we have observed across the cycles between architecture and the other two. About 46% of the fall submissions are ""interdisciplinary,"" namely, were associated with two or more of the three areas.Overall, throughout all the ASPLOS'24 cycles, we received 922 submissions, constituting a 1.54x increase compared to last year. Our reviewers submitted a total of 3,634 reviews containing more than 2.6 million words, and we also generated 12,655 online comments consisting of nearly 1.2 million words. As planned, PC members submitted an average of 15.7 reviews and a median of 15, and external review committee (ERC) members submitted an average of 4.7 and a median of 5.We accepted 170 papers thus far, written by 1100 authors, leading to an 18.4% acceptance rate, with the aforementioned 33 major revisions still under review. Assuming that the revision acceptance rate will be similar to that of previous cycles, we estimate that ASPLOS'24 will accept nearly 200 (!) papers, namely, 21%–22% of the submissions.The ASPLOS'24 program consists of 193 papers: the 170 papers we accepted thus far and, in addition, 23 major revisions from the fall cycle of ASPLOS'23, which were re-reviewed and accepted. The full details are available in the PDF of the front matter.","2024","2025-03-14 16:04:48","2025-03-14 16:04:48","","","","","3","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If users choose software, compute hardware and aircraft well, FAAS can complete missions faster and safer than unmanned aerial systems piloted by humans. On the other hand, poorly managed edge resources slow down missions, waste energy and inflate costs. This paper presents a model-driven approach to manage FAAS. We fly real FAAS missions, profile compute and aircraft resource usage and model expected demands. Naive profiling approaches use traces from previous flights to infer resource usage. However, edge resources can affect where FAAS fly and which data they sense. Usage profiles can diverge greatly across edge management policies. Instead of using traces, we characterize whole flight areas to accurately model resource usage for any flight path. We combine expected resource demands to model mission throughput, i.e., missions completed per fully charged battery. We validated our model by creating FAAS, measuring mission throughput across many system settings. Our FAAS benchmarks, released through our open source FAAS suite SoftwarePilot, execute realistic missions: autonomous photography, search and rescue, and agricultural scouting using well-known software. Our model predicted throughput with 4% error across mission, software and hardware settings. Competing approaches yielded 10–24% error. We used our SoftwarePilot benchmarks to study (1) GPU acceleration, scale up, and scale out, (2) onboard, edge and cloud computing, (3) energy and monetary budgets, and (4) software driven GPU management. We found that model-driven management can boost mission throughput by 10X and reduce costs by 87%.","2019","2025-03-14 16:04:48","2025-03-14 16:04:48","","74–87","","","","","","","SEC '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Arlington, Virginia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, we discuss three security services that are suitable for edge deployment: (i) an intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS), (ii) an access control enforcement system (ACE), and (iii) a communication anonymization service (CA).

For online services, short-term allocation can speed up targeted query executions and free up cache lines reserved, but normally not needed, for performance. However, in collocated settings, short-term allocation can increase cache contention, slowing down collocated query executions. To offset slowdowns, collocated services may request short-term allocation more often, making the problem worse. Short-term allocation policies manage which queries receive cache allocations and when. In collocated settings, these policies should balance targeted query speedups against slowdowns caused by recurring cache contention. We present a model-driven approach that (1) predicts response time under a given policy, (2) explores competing policies and (3) chooses policies that yield low response time for all collocated services. Our approach profiles cache usage offline, characterizes the effects of cache allocation policies using deep learning techniques and devises novel performance models for short-term allocation with online services. We tested our approach using data processing, cloud, and high-performance computing benchmarks collocated on Intel processors equipped with Cache Allocation Technology.

Although a number of direct control-based demand response solutions exist and have been successfully deployed and demonstrated in the real world, they are typically designed for, and are effective only at small scale and/or target specific types of loads, leading to relatively high cost-of-entry. This prohibits deploying scalable solutions.The H2020 GOFLEX project has addressed this issue and developed a scalable, general, and replicable so-called GOFLEX system, which offers a market-driven approach to solve congestion problems in distribution grids based on aggregated individual flexibilities from a wide range of prosumers, both small (incl. electric vehicles, heat-pumps, boilers, freezers, fridges) and large (incl. factories, water pumping stations, etc.). By encompassing individual prosumers, aggregators, distribution system operators, and energy multi-utilities and retailers. It is a system of systems, where all flexibilities in electricity demand, production, and storage are extracted, (dis)aggregated, optimized, and traded using the powerful and standardized FlexOffer format, yielding a general and replicable solution with low cost-of-entry. The system has been successfully deployed in Switzerland, Germany, and Cyprus where it has controlled loads of 500+ prosumers, with a total of 800MWh flexibility offered on the market, offering up to 64% of adaptability in peak demand. In this paper, we present the overall architecture of the GOFLEX system, its sub-systems, and the interaction between these sub-systems. We then discuss the configurations, observations, and key results of using the GOFLEX system both in the aforementioned 3 demo sites - within the GOFLEX project and after the project.","2022","2025-03-14 16:04:48","2025-03-14 16:04:48","","361–373","","","","","","","e-Energy '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have suggested that distributing AR services on an edge computing infrastructure can offer significant performance benefits, especially for consolidating concurrent clients. In this study, we shed light on several research challenges directly impacting the effective integration of distributed AR and edge computing. Specifically, we conduct extensive experiments by deploying our distributed stream processing-based AR pipeline, scAtteR, on a representative edge-cloud infrastructure managed by the Oakestra framework. We uncover several unapparent challenges that inhibit the effective marriage of distributed AR when deployed on edge and demonstrate the potential improvements through scAtteR++. We offer valuable insights and best practices to the growing AR research community, specifically those interested in leveraging edge and public cloud technologies for large-scale AR operations.","2023","2025-03-14 16:04:48","2025-03-14 16:04:48","","9–18","","","","","","","CoNEXT 2023","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Paris, France","","","","containers; orchestration; edge computing; Augmented reality; distributed stream processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the potential benefits of current graph processing platforms, they often encounter difficulties supporting diverse workloads, models, and languages. Moreover, existing platforms suffer from limited portability and interoperability, resulting in redundant efforts and inefficient resource and energy utilization due to vendor and even platform lock-in. To bridge the aforementioned gaps, the Graph-Massivizer project, funded by the Horizon Europe research and innovation program, conducts research and develops a high-performance, scalable, and sustainable platform for information processing and reasoning based on the massive graph (MG) representation of extreme data. In this paper, we briefly introduce the Graph-Massivizer platform. We explore how the emerging serverless computing paradigm can be leveraged to devise a scalable graph analytics tool over a codesigned computing continuum infrastructure.

Such applications are deployed on specially designed Edge Sensor Nodes (ESNs) that possess various sensors and limited computing power and support multiple data analysis tasks. ESNs encounter unique operational challenges, including intermittent power supplies, limited connectivity, and dynamic application and resource requirements, which complicate runtime management. Conventional resource management platforms like Kubernetes and KubeEdge are unsuitable for the dynamic needs of ESNs due to their reliance on centralized control and expected stable conditions. To bridge this gap, our paper introduces a data-driven resource management framework tailored for the autonomous adaptation of ESNs to diverse application and infrastructure requirements. We propose an intent-based mechanism that aligns application requirements, such as end-to-end latency, with infrastructure goals like utilization levels. This mechanism translates high-level intents into actionable low-level configurations, balancing the competing demands of various applications and resources, thereby guiding us toward a more robust and efficient application management system. We have implemented a prototype system, evaluated it on an experimental testbed, and demonstrated that our approach performs better than static-only optimization approaches with minimal impact on application performance.","2024","2025-03-14 16:04:48","2025-03-14 16:04:48","","1–8","","","","","","","FlexScience'24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Pisa, Italy","","","","edge computing; automated application management; environmental monitoring applications; intent-driven resource management; internet of things (IoT)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As data gathered from the Edge has to be transferred to the Cloud in order to be processed, the result will be a decreased responsiveness of the system. Also, devices might have to process data by themselves, as the Cloud could be unreachable at random moments in time, resulting in a reduction in battery life. Therefore, we propose an architecture that solves these problems, by introducing an intermediate layer, called Fog, which uses a task scheduling algorithm to send data received from Edge to another device that has enough resources and the required hardware and software to complete the task. In addition, the architecture is based on microservices, hence improving scalability and flexibility. In the performance analysis, we used different values to find the best node that should receive the data for processing. In addition, we compared the microservice based architecture with a monolithic one in order to see how the throughput and responsiveness of the system are affected.","2020","2025-03-14 16:04:48","2025-03-14 16:04:48","","1264–1271","","","","","","","SAC '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Brno, Czech Republic","","","","cloud computing; task scheduling; edge computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Software in CPS applications ranges from small systems to large systems, aka. Systems of Systems (SoS), such as smart grids and cities. CPSoS require managing massive amounts of data, being aware of their emerging behavior, and scaling out to progressively evolve and add new systems. Cloud computing supports processing and storing massive amounts of data, hosting and delivering services, and configuring self-provisioned resources. Therefore, cloud computing is the natural candidate to solve CPSoS needs. However, the diversity of platforms and the low-level cloud programming models make difficult to find a common solution for the development and deployment of CPSoS. This paper presents the architectural foundations of a cloud-centric framework for automating the development and deployment of CPSoS service applications to converge towards a common open service platform for CPSoS applications. This framework relies on the well-known qualities of the microservices architecture style, the autonomic computing paradigm, and the model-driven software development approach. Its implementation and validation is on-going at two European and national projects.","2016","2025-03-14 16:04:48","2025-03-14 16:04:48","","","","","","","","","ECSAW '16","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Copenhagen, Denmark","","","","cloud computing; microservices; software architecture; cyber-physical systems; model-driven development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current explorations consider Cloud Computing as the base stone to create IoT-Enable solution. Nonetheless, this environment entails limitations in terms of multi-hop distance from the data source, geographical centralized architecture, economical aspects, etc. To address these limitations, there is a surge of solutions that apply Fog Computing as an approach to bring computing resources closer to the data sources. This approach is being fomented by the growing availability of powerful edge computing at lower cost and commercial developments in the area. Nonetheless, the implementation of Cloud-Fog interoperability and integration implies in complex coordination of applications and services and the demand for intelligent service orchestrations so that solutions can make the best use of distributed resources without compromising stability, quality of services, and security. In this paper, we introduce a Fog-based IoT-Healthcare solution structure and explore the integration of Cloud-Fog services in interoperable Healthcare solutions extended upon the traditional Cloud-based structure. The scenarios are evaluated through simulations using the iFogSim simulator and the results analyzed in relation to distributed computing, reduction of latency, optimization of data communication, and power consumption. The experimental results point towards improvement in instance cost, network delay and energy usage.","2018","2025-03-14 16:04:48","2025-03-14 16:04:48","","","","","","","","","ICDCN '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Varanasi, India","","","","Cloud computing; Fog computing; Internet of Things; HealthCare; Interoperable architecture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, the resulting insights about the current air quality need to be actively queried by the citizens, leading to situations in which the citizen is exposed to a high air pollution without being aware of it. In this article, we introduce a context-aware air pollution monitoring and alert service that proactively notifies citizens via mobile devices about highly relevant air quality information once they enter an area with an air pollution that exceeds a user-defined threshold. The service continuously determines the concentration of particulate matter throughout a given urban area, detects closed areas with a high air pollution and shares this information with the citizen's mobile devices which are in turn responsible to regularly compare a citizen's position against the areas of poor air quality. As a proof of concept, we prototypically implemented and evaluated the service by means of real world measurements taken on consecutive days within an urban area in New Zealand.","2018","2025-03-14 16:04:48","2025-03-14 16:04:48","","","","","","","","","IOT '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Santa Barbara, California, USA","","","","air quality; context-aware computing; geofencing; location-based services; smart city; urban sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Deploying functions is mutually profitable: users need not be concerned with resource management, while providers can keep their servers at high utilization rates running thousands of functions concurrently on a single machine. It is exactly this high concurrency that comes at a cost. The standard Linux Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) switches often between tasks, which leads to prolonged execution times. We present evidence that relying on the default Linux CFS scheduler increases serverless workloads cost by up to 10×.In this article, we raise awareness and make a case for rethinking the OS-level scheduling in Linux for serverless workloads composed of many short-lived processes. To make serverless more affordable we introduce a hybrid two-level scheduling approach that relies on FaaS characteristics. Short-running functions are executed in FIFO fashion without preemption, while longer-running functions are passed to CFS after a certain time period. We show that tailor-made OS scheduling is able to significantly reduce user-facing costs without adding any provider-facing overhead.","2024","2025-03-14 16:04:48","2025-03-14 16:04:48","","172–184","","","","","","","Middleware '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Hong Kong, Hong Kong","","","","FaaS; serverless computing; cost for serverless; CPU scheduling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The solution aims to improve the quality and security of software by leveraging knowledge graph technology for a more accurate and comprehensive detection process of vulnerabilities. The ambition is to detect the vulnerabilities in the whole software supply chain and to support developers holding security as a key component over the Software Development life-cycle. We design reliable tools by building a semantic graph-based abstraction of the code from the compiler state, and we reach high accuracy by developing different static code analyzers optimizing the detection of software vulnerabilities in the source code and dependencies. In this paper, we will introduce the cybersecurity suite composed of different vulnerability detection tools to promote developer autonomy and security automation over the software supply chain. The main tool (DocSpot) detects vulnerabilities in the application source code and leverages knowledge graph technology. The second tool (DocDocker) scans for vulnerabilities in containers, and the third one (SirDocker) detects orchestration vulnerabilities, e.g. related to configuration, recommends secure best practices, and supports secure management of the containers and container images.

The majority of these apps process user-provided input to produce the desired results. Existing work in the area of input-sensitive profiling has empirically shown that many such apps have input size-dependent execution times which can be determined through modelling techniques. Nevertheless, existing serverless resource management frameworks are agnostic to the input size-sensitive nature of these apps. We demonstrate in this paper that this can potentially lead to container over-provisioning and/or end-to-end Service Level Objective (SLO) violations. To address this, we propose Cypress, an input size-sensitive resource management framework, that minimizes the containers provisioned for apps, while ensuring a high degree of SLO compliance. We perform an extensive evaluation of Cypress on top of a Kubernetes-managed cluster using 5 apps from the AWS Serverless Application Repository and/or Open-FaaS Function Store with real-world traces and varied input size distributions. Our experimental results show that Cypress spawns up to 66% fewer containers, thereby, improving container utilization and saving cluster-wide energy by up to 2.95X and 23%, respectively, versus state-of-the-art frameworks, while remaining highly SLO-compliant (up to 99.99%).","2022","2025-03-14 16:04:48","2025-03-14 16:04:48","","257–272","","","","","","","SoCC '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: San Francisco, California","","","","scheduling; serverless; input size; resource-management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While ML techniques enable dealing with several problems in self-adaptation, such as scalable decision-making, they are also subject to inherent challenges. In this paper, we focus on one such challenge that is particularly important for self-adaptation: ML techniques are designed to deal with a set of predefined tasks associated with an operational domain; they have problems to deal with new emerging tasks, such as concept shift in input data that is used for learning. To tackle this challenge, we present lifelong self-adaptation: a novel approach to self-adaptation that enhances self-adaptive systems that use ML techniques with a lifelong ML layer. The lifelong ML layer tracks the running system and its environment, associates this knowledge with the current tasks, identifies new tasks based on differentiations, and updates the learning models of the self-adaptive system accordingly. We present a reusable architecture for lifelong self-adaptation and apply it to the case of concept drift caused by unforeseen changes of the input data of a learning model that is used for decision-making in self-adaptation. We validate lifelong self-adaptation for two types of concept drift using two cases.","2022","2025-03-14 16:04:48","2025-03-14 16:04:48","","1–12","","","","","","","SEAMS '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents Silica: the first cloud storage system for archival data underpinned by quartz glass, an extremely resilient media that allows data to be left in situ indefinitely. The hardware and software of Silica have been co-designed and co-optimized from the media up to the service level with sustainability as a primary objective.

One technique for analyzing complex IT systems relies on emulation, where the final software system is fully deployed on real architectures, and is evaluated in considering ""small"" instances of situations the system is supposed to solve. We propose a software architecture for studying the ecosystem of 'smart buildings'. This software architecture is built: 1) on top of ontologies for the description of smart buildings; 2) on a special tool for mastering the life cycle of data produced by sensors and actuators inside the buildings.We assume that it is equally important to model both the building's components and the flow of data produced inside the building. We use existing software components for both goals and to make real our concerns. According to a translational methodology, we also discuss use cases for illustrating the potential of our approach and the particular challenges associated with making the two main components of our emulation tool inter-operate.Therefore, our main contribution is to propose a comprehensive, ambitious and realistic research plan to guide communities. The paper illustrates how computer scientists and smart buildings domain scientists may communicate to address and solve specific research problems related to Big Data in emergent distributed environments.

However, they usually treat an LC workload as a whole when allocating resources to BE jobs and neglect the different features of components of an LC workload. This kind of coarse-grained co-location method leaves a significant room for improvement in resource utilization.Based on the observation of the inconsistent interference tolerance abilities of different LC components, we propose a new abstraction called Servpod, which is a collection of a LC parts that are deployed on the same physical machine together, and show its merits on building a fine-grained co-location framework. The key idea is to differentiate the BE throughput launched with each LC Servpod, i.e., Servpod with high interference tolerance ability can be deployed along with more BE jobs. Based on Servpods, we present Rhythm, a co-location controller that maximizes the resource utilization while guaranteeing LC service's tail latency requirement. It quantifies the interference tolerance ability of each servpod through the analysis of tail-latency contribution. We evaluate Rhythm using LC services in forms of containerized processes and microservices, and find that it can improve the system throughput by 31.7%, CPU utilization by 26.2%, and memory bandwidth utilization by 34% while guaranteeing the SLA (service level agreement).","2020","2025-03-14 16:04:48","2025-03-14 16:04:48","","","","","","","","","EuroSys '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Heraklion, Greece","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research results show that the energy Internet information model based on information physical fusion takes into account the plug-and-play characteristics of distributed devices in the network, and at the same time reflects the multi-time scale characteristics of energy Internet, taking into account the autonomy of specific devices in the network and so on. From the experimental evaluation, it can be seen that big data mining has a good effect on data analysis and decision support in energy Internet cyber-physical systems.","2024","2025-03-14 16:04:48","2025-03-14 16:04:48","","198–203","","","","","","","ICEITSA '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Sanya, China","","","","data analysis; Big Data Mining; Cyberphysics; Decision Support; Energy Internet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The workshop is co-located with the 19th International Conference on emerging Networking EXperiments and Technologies (CoNEXT '23) and held in Paris, France, on the 8th of December 2023.Distributed ML is a rapidly evolving, interdisciplinary field bringing together techniques from Distributed Systems, Networks and Machine Learning. With Deep Learning at the forefront, we are seeing an explosion of AI-driven technologies, from immersive VR experiences and smart digital assistants to advanced robotics and autonomous vehicles. These applications not only challenge the limits of local device capabilities but also many times necessitate a shift towards distributed models of computation to enhance performance and efficiency, while respecting privacy and sustainability. At the cornerstone of innovation, foundational models further push the boundaries of today's computational infrastructure. Therefore, scaling up to support the new training workloads and efficiently deploying Large Language or Vision Models become key research areas.","2023","2025-03-14 16:04:48","2025-03-14 16:04:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the first time, ASPLOS has embarked on a new multi-deadline review model. ASPLOS ’23 features 3 deadlines spaced throughout the year and papers will be published in three volumes. Multiple deadlines are meant to encourage authors to submit their papers when ready and to facilitate the selection of some papers for revision. For this volume of ASPLOS ’23, we discontinued the use of the 2-page extended abstract submissions that were used in ASPLOS ’21 and ASPLOS ’22. We found the extended abstract offered limited filtering and moved to a more traditional two phase review process. Each paper received 3 reviews in phase 1 and papers with positive scores advanced to the second round and received up to 2 more reviews. In our preface to Volume III, we will give a more detailed rundown of how the process worked.","2023","2025-03-14 16:04:48","2025-03-14 16:04:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The advent of deep learning and the pursuit of artificial intelligence has created previously unfathomable deployments both in the datacenter and in the wild, enabling use-cases ranging from virtual reality and intelligent assistants to robots and self-driving cars. However, be it in the form of training or inference, these workloads pose several challenges pushing the compute, memory, sensing and networking capabilities of devices. As such, ML deployments become innately distributed, as a means to scale out local capabilities by leveraging remote or ambient resources in a distributed fashion in a collaborative manner. Simultaneously, the strive for user-privacy and sustainability gives birth to new training solutions, such as Federated Learning. However, adversarial actors may pose challenges to the robustness of the such deployments.Be it deployed in the cloud, edge or consumer end, Distributed ML challenges and pushes the limits of today's compute, networking and algorithmic frontier. To this end, the DistributedML workshop comes in a timely manner to provide a forum for ideas coming from different disciplines to be aired so as to solve current challenges and shape the technology of the future.","2022","2025-03-14 16:04:48","2025-03-14 16:04:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it remains challenging to carry the well-trained deep models for online real-time inference serving, with respect to the time-varying web-scale traffics from billions of users, in a cost-effective manner. In this work, we present JIZHI - a Model-as-a-Service system - that per second handles hundreds of millions of online inference requests to huge deep models with more than trillions of sparse parameters, for over twenty real-time recommendation services at Baidu, Inc. In JIZHI, the inference workflow of every recommendation request is transformed to a Staged Event-Driven Pipeline (SEDP), where each node in the pipeline refers to a staged computation or I/O intensive task processor. With traffics of real-time inference requests arrived, each modularized processor can be run in a fully asynchronized way and managed separately. Besides, JIZHI introduces the heterogeneous and hierarchical storage to further accelerate the online inference process by reducing unnecessary computations and potential data access latency induced by ultra-sparse model parameters. Moreover, an intelligent resource manager has been deployed to maximize the throughput of JIZHI over the shared infrastructure by searching the optimal resource allocation plan from historical logs and fine-tuning the load shedding policies over intermediate system feedback. Extensive experiments have been done to demonstrate the advantages of JIZHI from the perspectives of end-to-end service latency, system-wide throughput, and resource consumption. Since launched in July 2019, JIZHI has helped Baidu saved more than ten million US dollars in hardware and utility costs per year while handling 200% more traffics without sacrificing the inference efficiency.","2021","2025-03-14 16:04:48","2025-03-14 16:04:48","","3289–3298","","","","","","","KDD '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, Singapore","","","","intelligent resource management; MLOPS; online inference; recommendation system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of domain-specific languages for example, leads to the creation of numerous code generators that automatically translate highlevel system specifications into multi-target executable code. Producing correct and efficient code generator is complex and error-prone. Although software designers provide generally high-level test suites to verify the functional outcome of generated code, it remains challenging and tedious to verify the behavior of produced code in terms of non-functional properties. This paper describes a practical approach based on a runtime monitoring infrastructure to automatically check the potential inefficient code generators. This infrastructure, based on system containers as execution platforms, allows code-generator developers to evaluate the generated code performance. We evaluate our approach by analyzing the performance of Haxe, a popular high-level programming language that involves a set of cross-platform code generators. Experimental results show that our approach is able to detect some performance inconsistencies that reveal real issues in Haxe code generators.","2016","2025-03-14 16:04:48","2025-03-14 16:04:48","","202–212","","","","","","","GPCE 2016","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Amsterdam, Netherlands","","","","code generator; code quality; non-functional properties; testing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study presents a methodology that leverages the strengths of both serverless architecture and VMs to minimize operational costs and optimize performance. In this paper, to combines the benefits of serverless computing and VMs to enhance the utilization of cloud resources for switching mechanism. The algorithm promotes efficient resource allocation based on various metrics, including traffic load, cost, and execution time. Additionally, we employ a PID controller for facilitating seamless transitions between serverless and VM environments.

Software Performance Antipatterns (SPAs) research has focused on algorithms for the characterization, detection, and solution of antipatterns. However, existing algorithms are based on the analysis of runtime behavior to detect trends on several monitored variables (e.g., response time, CPU utilization, and number of threads) using pre-defined thresholds. Objective. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for SPA characterization and detection designed to support continuous integration/delivery/deployment (CI/CDD) pipelines, with the goal of addressing the lack of computationally efficient algorithms.Method. Our approach includes SPA statistical characterization using a multivariate analysis approach of load testing experimental results to identify the services that have the largest impact on system scalability.More specifically, we introduce a layered decomposition approach that implements statistical analysis based on response time to characterize load testing experimental results. A distance function is used to match experimental results to SPAs.Results. We have instantiated the introduced methodology by applying it to a large complex telecom system. We were able to automatically identify the top five services that are scalability choke points. In addition, we were able to automatically identify one SPA. We have validated the engineering aspects of our methodology and the expected benefits by means of a domain experts' survey.Conclusion. We contribute to the state-of-the-art by introducing a novel approach to support computationally efficient SPA characterization and detection in large complex systems using performance testing results. We have compared the computational efficiency of the proposed approach with state-of-the-art heuristics. We have found that the approach introduced in this paper grows linearly, which is a significant improvement over existing techniques.","2021","2025-03-14 16:04:48","2025-03-14 16:04:48","","61–72","","","","","","","ICPE '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, France","","","","multivariate analysis; software performance antipattern characterization; software performance antipattern detection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wireless mesh networks experience significant temporal and spatial variations in link bandwidth. When application components, modeled as a directed acyclic graph, need to be scheduled on such a mesh with bandwidth constraints (and variations), the problem of mapping components to specific compute nodes becomes an instance of bin packing with constraints of CPU, memory, and bandwidth limits within the mesh. To make the scheduling tractable, we propose BASS (Bandwidth Aware Scheduling System), and develop heuristics for scheduling, based on the directed graph topology of the application components. We evaluate BASS on an emulated mesh using bandwidth traces collected from an actual wireless testbed - CityLab. Detailed evaluations show that contemporary orchestration frameworks can plug in BASS to provide better end-to-end performance for the applications deployed on the mesh while reducing resource utilization.","2024","2025-03-14 16:04:48","2025-03-14 16:04:48","","131–144","","","","","","","Middleware '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Hong Kong, Hong Kong","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They offer optimal resource allocation and service distribution, hence allow for full utilization of the opportunities provided by those networks. Orchestrators make use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to determine the most optimal operational decisions, such as deployment and scaling of services, ensuring the quality of the service performance. The training and validation of these models require significant amount of data. However, in such environments we deal with heterogeneous and distributed data sources, in which the data needs to be collected and pre-processed efficiently, and as such, made ready-to-use for these ML models. Hence, in this paper several state-of-the-art data management technologies suitable for edge computing and orchestration are investigated and compared. After investigating the theoretical features of these technologies, they are deployed and tested on the Smart Highway testbed. The strengths and shortcomings of these systems are presented and compared based on the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for various vehicular services dealing with highly mobile users, i.e., vehicles, which are considered as quite stringent. This hybrid platform, combining several data management technologies, will be used to assist and enrich the research on smart edge orchestration at IDLab and serve as a reference for other interested parties.","2022","2025-03-14 16:04:49","2025-03-14 16:04:49","","118–124","","","","","","","GoodIT '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Limassol, Cyprus","","","","Edge Computing; ActiveMQ; Data Management; Edge Orchestration; Kafka; Pulsar; V2X; Zenoh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The continued evolution of computing hardware and infrastructure imposes new challenges and bottlenecks to program performance. As a result, traditional database architectures that focus solely on I/O optimization increasingly fail to utilize hardware resources efficiently. Multi-core CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, new memory and storage technologies (such as flash and non-volatile memory), and low-power hardware impose great challenges to optimizing database performance. Consequently, exploiting the characteristics of modern hardware has become an important topic of database systems research.The goal is to make database systems adapt automatically to the sophisticated hardware characteristics, thus maximizing performance transparently to applications. To achieve this goal, the data management community needs interdisciplinary collaboration with computer architecture, compiler, operating systems, and storage researchers. This involves rethinking traditional data structures, query processing algorithms, and database software architectures to adapt to the advances in the underlying hardware infrastructure. For the DaMoN Workshop, we seek submissions bridging the area of database systems to computer architecture, compilers, and operating systems.","2023","2025-03-14 16:04:49","2025-03-14 16:04:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One rare place where energy and water coincide is in water heaters, which consume over 30% of household energy in South Africa and collectively pass over 500 billion litres of water annually. These resource-hungry devices are not well managed and tend to be physically inaccessible and difficult to understand for users. The advent of wireless and cloud computing technology brought expectations of simple management of a multitude of devices and the so-called Internet of Things. A few solutions have been proposed for remote water heater management, but these are not scalable, and have not been benchmarked for scalability above tens of units. This paper proposes an end-to-end architecture to monitor and control EWHs based on MQTT, and specific emphasis is placed on the technologies suitable for large-scale cross-domain interoperability.

The related video streaming/analytics requires real-time drone-to-Ground Control Station (GCS) communication and computation co-ordination for desired user Quality of Experience (QoE). In situations where the quality of the video can be affected by occlusions (e.g., image distortion, frame stalling) due to network bottlenecks, there is a need to dynamically make decisions on the computation offloading and networking protocols in order to properly handle the video data for real world application purposes. In this paper, we propose a novel function-centric computing approach that helps a user to perform drone video analytics to assess a wide-area scene to chart a plan of action. Our approach involves handling network impairments affecting the switching between high resolution/low resolution video capture, or change of camera direction for assessment of the scene effectively. It also features a novel video quality enhancing algorithm based on occlusion-detection that adapts to video impairments related to image distortion and frame stalling. Our experiment results from a realistic testbed show that our approach can efficiently choose the suitable networking protocols (i.e., TCP/HTTP, UDP/RTP, QUIC) and orchestrate both the camera control on the drone, and the computation off-loading of the video analytics over limited edge computing resources. The performance improvements for computation off-loading involving our video quality enhancing algorithm are shown for different network conditions in terms of occlusion rate and processing times.","2020","2025-03-14 16:04:49","2025-03-14 16:04:49","","","","","","","","","ICDCN '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Kolkata, India","","","","Computation off-loading; Drone video analytics; Multimedia networking protocols; Network management; Occlusion detection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Production-level systems use lightweight combinations of historical information to enable practical deployments. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) models, in particular Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, have been proposed by various works, for their improved predictive capabilities. Following this trend, we train LSTM models and observe high levels of prediction accuracy, even on unseen data. Upon meticulous visual inspection of the results, we notice that although the predicted values seem highly accurate, they are nothing but versions of the original data shifted by one time step into the future. Yet, this clear shift seems to be enough to produce a robust forecast, because the values are highly correlated across time. We investigate time series data of various resource usage metrics (CPU, memory, network, disk I/O) across different cloud providers and levels, such as at the physical or virtual machine-level and at the application job-level. We observe that resource utilization displays very small variations in consecutive time steps. This insight can enable very simple solutions, such as data shifts, to be used for cloud resource forecasting and deliver highly accurate predictions. This is the reason why we ask whether complex machine learning models are even necessary to use. We envision that practical resource management systems need to first identify the extent to which simple solutions can be effective, and resort to using machine learning to the extent that enables its practical use.","2023","2025-03-14 16:04:49","2025-03-14 16:04:49","","544–554","","","","","","","SoCC '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Santa Cruz, CA, USA","","","","Machine Learning; Cloud Computing; Data Persistence; Forecasting; Long Short Term Memory; Persistent Forecast; Prediction; Resource Usage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents an innovative Decision Support Framework (DDSF), for managing higher education systems. The DDSF utilizes real time information extraction to improve the decision-making process. It combines data analytics and user centric design to provide insights to education administrators. By gathering data from sources like records, financial reports and social media analytics the DDSF uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to extract and interpret real time information. This information is then organized in a manner for analysis. The framework is adaptable allowing for the inclusion of emerging data streams ensuring relevance and usefulness. To evaluate the effectiveness of the DDSF we conducted a pilot study at a university. The results indicated improvements in meeting student needs optimizing resource allocation and enhancing operational efficiency. The framework also enables policy development by foreseeing challenges and identifying opportunities, within the education sector. The DDSF brings about a way of managing education by providing a strong platform for institutions to succeed in a competitive and constantly evolving environment. It emphasizes the significance of extracting real time information to guide planning and operational excellence.

An integrative and interoperable IoT platform proves to be a suitable execution environment for Smart City services because users simultaneously use multiple services, while an IoT platform enables cross-service data sharing. A large number of various IoT and mobile devices as well as the corresponding services can generate tremendous input load on an underlying IoT platform. Thus, it is crucial to analyze the overall input rate on Smart City services to ensure predefined quality of service (e.g., low latency required by some IoT services). An aggregate input rate which characterizes a real world deployment can be used to check if a platform is able to adequately support multiple services running in parallel and to evaluate its overall performance.In this paper we review IoT-based Smart City services to identify key applications characterizing the domain, e.g., smart mobility, smart utilities, and citizen-driven mobile crowd sensing services. Next, we analyze the potential load which such applications pose on IoT services that continuously process the generated data streams. The analysis is used to create a model estimating an aggregate load generated by Smart City applications. We simulate a number of characteristic application compositions to provide insight about the aggregate input load and its potential impact on the performance of Smart City services. The proposed model is a first step towards predicting the processing load of Smart City services to facilitate the assessment and planning of required resources for continuous processing of sensor data in the context of Smart City services.","2017","2025-03-14 16:04:49","2025-03-14 16:04:49","","34–43","","","","","","","DEBS '17","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Barcelona, Spain","","","","Internet of Things; input load; model; Smart City services","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

UbiComp and ISWC are premier interdisciplinary venues for international researchers, designers, developers, practitioners and educators in the field to present and discuss novel and impactful research in interactive, mobile, wearable and ubiquitous computing. The companion program has traditionally been a very important part of the UbiComp/ISWC conference series.UbiComp/ISWC 2024 is held from October 5 to 9, 2024 in Melbourne, Australia. Originally, UbiComp/ISWC was scheduled to take place in Melbourne in 2021. However, due to the significant impact of COVID-19, our community decided to postpone conferences taking place in their traditional form until last year, when UbiComp took place as an in-person event in Mexico. Now, in 2024 we look to consolidate the strength and ties in our community by having another fully in-person event and hoping to welcome a new generation of researchers to meet and explore the wonderful people that make up our community.","2024","2025-03-14 16:04:49","2025-03-14 16:04:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we propose DeepRecSched, a recommendation inference scheduler that maximizes latency-bounded throughput by taking into account characteristics of inference query size and arrival patterns, model architectures, and underlying hardware systems. By carefully optimizing task versus data-level parallelism, DeepRecSched improves system throughput on server class CPUs by 2x across eight industry-representative models.

This enables real-time processing, reduces latency, and improves user experiences, particularly with the advent of 5G networks. However, the limited resources of edge servers pose a challenge in ensuring service-level agreement (SLA) while optimizing resource utilization. Autoscaling, a dynamic resource adjustment mechanism, can play a pivotal role in meeting these demands. This paper explores the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to address autoscaling in MEC. The proposed algorithm models the horizontal autoscaling problem in MEC, defines state and action spaces, and introduces a global reward function. Additionally, time-series data prediction enhances scaling responsiveness. A testing platform is employed to validate the algorithm’s effectiveness. This work contributes a novel approach to autoscaling in MEC, addressing the complex interplay of autonomous scaling decisions, SLA compliance, and resource optimization within edge server clusters.","2024","2025-03-14 16:04:49","2025-03-14 16:04:49","","520–527","","","","","","","ICCIP '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Lingshui, China","","","","autoscaling; mobile edge computing; reinforcement learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Modern sNICs have fully programmable, energy-efficient multi-core processors on which many packet processing functions, including a full-blown programmable switch, can run. However, having multiple switch instances deployed across the host hypervisor and the attached sNICs makes controlling them difficult and data plane operations more complex.This paper proposes a generalized SDN-controlled NF offload architecture called UNO. It can transparently offload dynamically selected host processors' packet processing functions to sNICs by using multiple switches in the host while keeping the data centerwide network control and management planes unmodified. UNO exposes a single virtual control plane to the SDN controller and hides dynamic NF offload behind a unified virtual management plane. This enables UNO to make optimal use of host's and sNIC's combined packet processing capabilities with local optimization based on locally observed traffic patterns and resource consumption, and without central controller involvement. Experimental results based on a real UNO prototype in realistic scenarios show promising results: it can save processing worth up to 8 CPU cores, reduce power usage by up to 2x, and reduce the control plane overhead by more than 50%.","2017","2025-03-14 16:04:49","2025-03-14 16:04:49","","506–519","","","","","","","SoCC '17","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Santa Clara, California","","","","networking and SDNs; virtualization and containers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The benefits include reduced latency for communication, less network traffic and increased privacy for data processing. However, there are challenges as IoT devices have limited resources for running multiple simultaneous containerized functions, and also FaaS does not typically support long-running functions. Our implementation utilizes Docker and CRIU for checkpointing and suspending long-running blocking functions. The results show that checkpointing is slightly slower than regular Docker pause, but it saves memory and allows for more long-running functions to be run on an IoT device. Furthermore, the resulting checkpoint files are small, hence they are suitable for live migration and backing up stateful functions, therefore improving availability and reliability of the system.","2019","2025-03-14 16:04:49","2025-03-14 16:04:49","","60–65","","","","","","","EdgeSys '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Dresden, Germany","","","","serverless; Internet of Things; checkpointing; function as a service; light-weight virtualization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A high performance User Plane Function (UPF), the main element in the 5G user plane, is critical to achieving these performance goals. This paper presents AccelUPF, a 5G UPF that offloads functionality to programmable dataplane hardware for performance acceleration. While prior work has proposed accelerating the UPF by offloading its data forwarding functionality to programmable hardware, the Packet Forwarding Control Protocol (PFCP) messages from the control plane that configure the hardware data forwarding rules were still processed in software. We show that only offloading data forwarding and not PFCP message processing leads to suboptimal performance in the UPF for applications like IoT that have a much higher ratio of PFCP messages to data traffic, due to a bottleneck at the software control plane that configures the hardware packet forwarding rules. In contrast to prior work, AccelUPF offloads both PFCP message processing as well as data forwarding to programmable hardware. AccelUPF overcomes several technical challenges pertaining to the processing of the complex variable-sized PFCP messages within the memory and compute constraints of programmable hardware platforms. Our evaluation of AccelUPF implemented over a Netronome programmable NIC and an Intel Tofino programmable switch demonstrates performance gains over the state-of-the-art UPFs for real-world traffic scenarios.","2022","2025-03-14 16:04:49","2025-03-14 16:04:49","","1–15","","","","","","","SOSR '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event","","","","in-network computation; 5G core; 5G user plane; programmable networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Alternative technologies, such as NVMe SSDs and upcoming NVM devices, offer higher capacity than DRAM at a fraction of the cost and power. One promising approach is to transparently offload colder memory to cheaper memory technologies via kernel or hypervisor techniques. The key challenge, however, is to develop a datacenter-scale solution that is robust in dealing with diverse workloads and large performance variance of different offload devices such as compressed memory, SSD, and NVM. This paper presents TMO, Meta’s transparent memory offloading solution for heterogeneous datacenter environments. TMO introduces a new Linux kernel mechanism that directly measures in realtime the lost work due to resource shortage across CPU, memory, and I/O. Guided by this information and without any prior application knowledge, TMO automatically adjusts how much memory to offload to heterogeneous devices (e.g., compressed memory or SSD) according to the device’s performance characteristics and the application’s sensitivity to memory-access slowdown. TMO holistically identifies offloading opportunities from not only the application containers but also the sidecar containers that provide infrastructure-level functions. To maximize memory savings, TMO targets both anonymous memory and file cache, and balances the swap-in rate of anonymous memory and the reload rate of file pages that were recently evicted from the file cache. TMO has been running in production for more than a year, and has saved between 20-32% of the total memory across millions of servers in our large datacenter fleet. We have successfully upstreamed TMO into the Linux kernel.","2022","2025-03-14 16:04:49","2025-03-14 16:04:49","","609–621","","","","","","","ASPLOS '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Lausanne, Switzerland","","","","Datacenters; Memory Management; Non-volatile Memory; Operating Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These monolithic applications rely on vertical scaling, adjusting CPU cores based on load fluctuations. However, our analysis of Kubernetes-based Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) offerings at Microsoft revealed that many customers consistently over-provision resources for peak workloads, neglecting cost-saving opportunities through resource scale-down. We found that there is a gap in the ability of existing vertical autoscaling tools to minimize resource slack and respond promptly to throttling, leading to increased costs and impacting crucial metrics such as throughput and availability.To address this challenge, we propose CaaSPER, a vertical autoscaling algorithm that blends reactive and proactive strategies. By dynamically adjusting CPU resources, CaaSPER minimizes resource slack, maintains optimal CPU utilization, and reduces throttling. Importantly, customers have the flexibility to prioritize either cost savings or high performance based on their preferences. Extensive testing demonstrates that CaaSPER effectively reduces throttling and keeps CPU utilization within target levels. CaaSPER is designed to be application-agnostic and platform-agnostic, with potential for extension to other applications requiring vertical autoscaling.","2024","2025-03-14 16:04:49","2025-03-14 16:04:49","","241–254","","","","","","","SIGMOD/PODS '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Santiago AA, Chile","","","","kubernetes; containers; resource optimization; vertical auto-scaling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

So far, there are almost no attempts to make the past application history programmatically accessible or even modifiable. This is primarily due to the complexity of temporal changes and a difficult alignment with prevalent programming primitives and persistence strategies. Retroactive computing enables powerful capabilities though, including computations and predictions of alternate application timelines, post-hoc bug fixes, or retroactive state explorations. We propose an event-driven programming model that is oriented towards serverless computing and applies retroaction to the event sourcing paradigm. Our model is deliberately restrictive, but therefore keeps the complexity of retroactive operations in check. We introduce retro-λ, a runtime platform that implements the model and provides retroactive capabilites to its applications. While retro-λ only shows negligible performance overheads compared to similar solutions for running regular applications, it enables its users to execute retroactive computations on the application histories as part of its programming model.","2018","2025-03-14 16:04:49","2025-03-14 16:04:49","","76–87","","","","","","","DEBS '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Hamilton, New Zealand","","","","serverless computing; event processing; event sourcing; event-driven architecture; retroaction; retroactive computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We believe that an in-person conference is beneficial for several reasons: it fosters direct engagement and networking opportunities, enhances the exchange of research ideas, contributes to a more dynamic and productive conference experience, and nurtures our research community by welcoming newcomers, providing them with the opportunity to become acquainted with SIGIR traditions. This decision has not been made lightly. We understand the challenges that can pose in the aftermath of a pandemic and amidst the uncertainties of the world around us. To accommodate those who cannot attend, we have implemented a series of measures such as proxy presenters, livestreaming, and recording sessions. These steps are taken to ensure that everyone has access to the valuable content that the conference offers.","2024","2025-03-14 16:04:49","2025-03-14 16:04:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Networked applications can leak sensitive information even when they use encryption. For example, some characteristics of network packets, such as their size, timing and direction, are visible even for encrypted traffic. Patterns in these characteristics can be leveraged as side channels to extract information about secret values accessed by the application. In this paper, we present a new tool called AutoFeed for detecting and quantifying information leakage due to side channels in networked software applications. AutoFeed profiles the target system and automatically explores the input space, explores the space of output features that may leak information, quantifies the information leakage, and identifies the top-leaking features. Given a set of input mutators and a small number of initial inputs provided by the user, AutoFeed iteratively mutates inputs and periodically updates its leakage estimations to identify the features that leak the greatest amount of information about the secret of interest. AutoFeed uses a feedback loop for incremental profiling, and a stopping criterion that terminates the analysis when the leakage estimation for the top-leaking features converges. AutoFeed also automatically assigns weights to mutators in order to focus the search of the input space on exploring dimensions that are relevant to the leakage quantification. Our experimental evaluation on the benchmarks shows that AutoFeed is effective in detecting and quantifying information leaks in networked applications.","2020","2025-03-14 16:04:49","2025-03-14 16:04:49","","260–271","","","","","","","ISSTA 2020","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, USA","","","","dynamic program analysis; input generation; network traffic analysis; Side-channel analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A central issue is the lack of systematic performance engineering approaches that take into account the specific characteristics of these systems. To address this problem, we suggest a methodology for performance engineering and performance analysis of distributed event-sourced systems based on specific measurements and subsequent, targeted optimizations. The methodology blends in well into existing software engineering processes and helps developers to identify bottlenecks and to resolve performance issues.

The Software 2.0 paradigm is a data-driven programming that requires specialized data management to get clean, governed and unbiased data sets, well defined neural network architectures for building a model, efficient model training, extensive testing and high performance deployment. Unlike Software 1.0 paradigm, a Software 2.0 program's output is probabilistic in nature as the correctness is highly dependent on the size and quality of the input data, however the program's performance is deterministic. This has led to the research in specialized hardware and high performance architectures for deep-learning algorithms. Also, the nature of Software 2.0 paradigm brings in heterogeneity in the whole life cycle starting from an application development until its deployment in the production environment and hence posing numerous architecture and performance challenges.In this paper, we outline the research problems that will emerge due to migration of apart of Software 1.0 to Software 2.0. We present the challenges and the approaches to address them, for accelerating the development and deployment of Software 2.0 programs.

We extend this FaaS model so that it is suitable for use in all tiers of scale for IoT - sensors, edge devices, and cloud - to facilitate robust, portable, and low-latency IoT application development and deployment.To enable this, we combine the use of Linux containers and namespaces for isolation and portability, an append-only object store for robust persistence, and a causal event log for triggering functions and tracking event dependencies. We present the design and implementation of CSPOT, detail its abstractions and APIs, and overview examples of its use.

Thereby, various physical entities, humans and computer programs are dynamically networked while being situated in different locations. For system stakeholders, reliable operation requires intelligible design and adaptability at run time. The more users can adjust IoT systems dynamically, the more transparent has to be how specific requirements can be met. Executable and role-specific process models are a viable starting point, as they represent the behavior of components and the flow of control. However, they need to be extended with effective data exchange mechanisms between IoT system elements. In this paper, we utilize the subject-oriented concept and notation for role-specific process modeling and communication design of IoT systems and enrich them with a data sharing facility, so-called shared input pools. In order to avoid a single point of failure in system operation, we propose to implement them as blockchains. IoT-elements can then interact and exchange data in a semantically correct and robust way, in particular when behavior changes may occur dynamically.","2019","2025-03-14 16:04:49","2025-03-14 16:04:49","","","","","","","","","S-BPM ONE '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Seville, Spain","","","","internet of things; events; reliable communications; S-BPM; shared input pool; subject orientation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, it has advantages of low-cost, low-energy, and high-robustness, showing great potential in resources-constrained, volatile, and latency-critical applications, which are critical for future HPC, cloud, and edge applications. However, the promised significant performance gain of BNN inference has never been fully demonstrated on general-purpose processors, particularly on GPUs, due to: (i) the challenge of extracting and leveraging sufficient finegrained bit-level-parallelism to saturate GPU cores when the batch size is small; (ii) the fundamental design conflict between bit-based BNN algorithm and word-based architecture; and (iii) architecture &amp; performance unfriendly to BNN network design. To address (i) and (ii), we propose a binarized-soft-tensor-core as a software-hardware codesign approach to construct bit-manipulation capability for modern GPUs and thereby effectively harvest bit-level-parallelism (BLP). To tackle (iii), we propose intra- and inter-layer fusion techniques so that the entire BNN inference execution can be packed into a single GPU kernel, and so avoid the high-cost of frequent launching and releasing. Experiments show that our Singular-Binarized-Neural-Network (SBNN) design can achieve over 1000X speedup for raw inference latency over the state-of-the-art full-precision BNN inference for AlexNet on GPUs. Comparisons with CPU, GPU, FPGA and Xeon-Phi demonstrate the effectiveness of our design.

For the first time since 1978, our symposium is being held in the ""Steel City"" of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at the intersection of the Allegheny, Ohio, and Monongahela rivers. We are looking forward to four days of productive and informative presentations, vibrant and engaging discussions, and an overall wonderful experience with our SIGCSE community members. We are confident that our program of events provides meaningful and productive experiences for all.Our theme for this year is ""Leading the Transformation"". Our theme reflects the role of the computer science education community in adapting educational practice to new technologies and challenges. With advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) transforming both academia and the workplace, the computer science education community has a unique opportunity to help shape the future use and application of computing. Our program this year is quite diverse and offers something for everyone, so please take time to peruse the schedule and choose the sessions which appeal to you. Pittsburgh is also an exciting city with lots to see and do, so you are encouraged to enjoy all the city has to offer.The format of the 2025 Technical Symposium is similar to 2024 in many ways. We will once again have a program that extends into Saturday afternoon, including papers and the Nifty Assignment session after lunch. We will also again have three Birds-of-a-Feather sessions, two on Thursday evening and one during lunch on Friday. For online attendees, we will continue to offer streaming of keynotes, the Nifty Assignment session, the First-Timers Lunch presentation, and a small set of paper, panel, and special sessions.This year we received almost 1200 submissions. Submission statistics for all of the Technical Symposium's tracks can be found in the table that follows. Papers were submitted to one of three tracks (Computing Education Research, Experience Reports and Tools, Position and Curricula Initiatives) with reviewing tailored to each track. Each paper submission was reviewed by at least three reviewers, with a substantial proportion of papers receiving four (or more) reviews, plus a meta review. We sincerely appreciate the work of the more than 800 reviewers and 112 Associate Program Chairs who contributed to the creation of this years' program. Their reviews helped us decide which submissions were accepted while also providing detailed feedback that allowed authors to further improve the final versions of their submissions.","2025","2025-03-14 16:04:50","2025-03-14 16:04:50","","","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
