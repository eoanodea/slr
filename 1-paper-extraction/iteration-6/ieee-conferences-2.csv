However, with recent advancements, hosting QPUs will soon be possible everywhere. Existing work has yet to draw from research in edge computing to explore systems exploiting mobile QPUs, or how hybrid applications can benefit from distributed heterogeneous resources. Hence, this work presents an architecture for Quantum Computing in the edge-cloud continuum. We discuss the necessity, challenges, and solution approaches for extending existing work on classical edge computing to integrate QPUs. We describe how warm-starting allows defining workflows that exploit the hierarchical resources spread across the continuum. Then, we introduce a distributed inference engine with hybrid classical-quantum neural networks (QNNs) to aid system designers in accommodating applications with complex requirements that incur the highest degree of heterogeneity. We propose solutions focusing on classical layer partitioning and quantum circuit cutting to demonstrate the potential of utilizing classical and quantum computation across the continuum. To evaluate the importance and feasibility of our vision, we provide a proof of concept that exemplifies how extending a classical partition method to integrate quantum circuits can improve the solution quality. Specifically, we implement a split neural network with optional hybrid QNN predictors. Our results show that extending classical methods with QNNs is viable and promising for future work.","","979-8-3503-0479-4","10.1109/QSW59989.2023.00021","Eni; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10234305","Quantum Computing;Edge Computing;Compute Continuum;Split Computing;Circuit Cutting;Task Partitioning;DNN Partitioning;Classical-Quantum Hybrid Machine Learning;Quantum Neural Networks;Warm-Starting","Neural networks;Focusing;Computer architecture;Software;Quantum circuit;Task analysis;Artificial intelligence","","10","","71","IEEE","1 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The serverless technology simplified how to build cloud applications and use resources, becoming a driving force in consolidating the continuum with the deployment of small functions with short execution. However, the adaptation of serverless to the edge-cloud continuum brings new challenges mainly related to resource management and scheduling. Standard cloud scheduling policies are based on greedy algorithms that do not efficiently handle platforms' heterogeneity nor deal with problems such as cold start delays. This work introduces a new scheduling policy that tries to address these issues. It is based on multi-objective optimization for data transfers and makespan while considering heterogeneity. Using simulations that vary workloads, platforms, and heterogeneity levels, we study the system utilization, the trade-offs between the targets, and the impacts of considering platforms' heterogeneity. We perform comparisons with a baseline inspired by a Kubernetes-based policy, representing greedy algorithms. Our experiments show considerable gaps between the efficiency of a greedy-based scheduling policy and a multi-objective-based one. The last outperforms the baseline by reducing makespan, data transfers, and system utilization by up to two orders of magnitudes in relevant cases for the edge-cloud continuum.","","979-8-3503-0119-9","10.1109/CCGrid57682.2023.00052","European Union(grant numbers:GA101017047); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10171469","Scheduling Policies;Serverless Computing;Edge-Cloud Continuum;Heterogeneous Platforms","Greedy algorithms;Cloud computing;Processor scheduling;Force;Data transfer;Scheduling;Delays","","6","","37","IEEE","10 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The absence of always-on hosting costs associated with virtual machines enables serverless functions to be deployed with many different function configurations and cloud regions to achieve high performance, low network latency, and reduced costs. In this paper, we investigate the utility of a global sky computing platform where serverless resources are aggregated between up to 19 distinct cloud regions. We prototype a serverless load distribution system to distribute client requests across serverless aggregations to minimize performance objectives, including network latency, runtime, hosting costs, and carbon footprint. To evaluate our serverless distribution system's ability to meet performance objectives, we continuously executed large experiments across 19 regions around the world from November 2022 through March 2023. Our serverless load distribution approach using aggregated resources reduced the carbon intensity of a globally distributed serverless application by up to 99.8%, network latency by 65%, or hosting costs by 58% by optimizing function routing to deployments with optimal hardware configurations.","2694-0825","979-8-3503-4394-6","10.1109/IC2E59103.2023.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10305816","Sky Computing;Serverless Computing;Function-as-a-Service;Green Computing","Cloud computing;Costs;Runtime;Prototypes;Pricing;Routing;Virtual machining","","6","","26","IEEE","6 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An alternative is hashed page tables (HPTs) where, conceptually, address translation needs only one memory access. Traditionally, HPTs have been shunned due to high costs of handling conflicts and other limitations. However, recent advances have made HPTs compelling. Still, a major issue in HPT designs is their requirement for substantial contiguous physical memory.This paper addresses this problem. To minimize HPTs’ contiguous memory needs, it introduces the Logical to Physical (L2P) Table and the use of Dynamically-Changing Chunk Sizes. These techniques break down the HPT into discontiguous physical-memory chunks. In addition, the paper also introduces two techniques that minimize HPTs’ total memory needs and, indirectly, reduce the memory contiguity requirements. These techniques are In-place Page Table Resizing and Per-way Resizing. We call our complete design Memory-Efficient HPTs (ME-HPTs). Compared to state-of-the-art HPTs, ME-HPTs: (i) reduce the contiguous memory allocation needs by 92% on average, and (ii) improve the performance by 8.9% on average. For the two most demanding workloads, the contiguous memory requirements decrease from 64MB to 1MB. In addition, compared to state-of-the-art radix-tree page tables, ME-HPTs achieve an average speedup of 1.23× (without huge pages) and 1.28× (with huge pages).","2378-203X","978-1-6654-7652-2","10.1109/HPCA56546.2023.10071061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10071061","Virtual memory;Page tables;Hashed page tables","Costs;Scalability;Memory management;Resource management","","6","","91","IEEE","24 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fine-granular resource management guarantees better computing resource usage, which is critical to reducing energy consumption and resource wastage (vital in edge computing). In this paper, we propose a novel Zero-touch management (ZSM) framework featuring a fine-granular computing resource scaler in a cloud-native environment. The proposed scaler algorithm uses Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) models to predict microservice performances; if a service degradation is detected, then a root-cause analysis is conducted using eXplainable AI (XAI). Based on the XAI output, the proposed framework scales only the needed (exact amount) resources (i.e., CPU or memory) to overcome the service degradation. The proposed framework and resource scheduler have been implemented on top of a cloud-native platform based on the well-known Kubernetes tool. The obtained results clearly indicate that the proposed scheduler with lesser resources achieves the same service quality as the default scheduler of Kubernetes.","2693-9789","979-8-3503-9980-6","10.1109/NetSoft57336.2023.10175438","AC3; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10175438","Zero-touch Service Management (ZSM);Cloud-native;Containerized Microservices;Machine Learning;Explainable Artificial Intelligence","Degradation;Energy consumption;Memory management;Microservice architectures;Learning (artificial intelligence);Predictive models;Prediction algorithms","","5","","16","IEEE","13 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This presents significant management complexity that must be addressed if serverless technologies are to be used in production systems.

A new perspective is required to manage these systems, considering the infrastructure and components from edge to cloud, i.e., in the distributed computing continuum. Serverless computing offers improved scalability and cost efficiency, but balancing and coordinating serverless systems remain complex. Intent-based systems, popular in networking, can provide a solution by translating stakeholder inputs into actions that meet Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Their application in the computing continuum can be highly beneficial, but it has yet to be deeply explored. To bridge this gap, we propose a methodology for deploying an intent-based system for the computing continuum. We implement an architectural framework leveraging the serverless paradigm. Furthermore, we focus on defining and implementing the main components for translating the management requirements into actions executed by serverless functions inspired by a three-layer model. Through a Proof of Concept (PoC) deployed in Amazon's AWS cloud and detailed simulations, we showcase how such an approach can resolve conflicts in a complex system, i.e., balancing efficiency and availability.

Traditional resource provisioning strategies, such as configuring a cluster per peak utilization, lead to low resource efficiency. Serverless computing is a promising way to avoid wasteful resource provisioning since video analytics regularly encounters bursty input workloads and finegrained video content dynamics. For serverless-based video analytics, the application configuration (frame rate, detection model, and computation resources) will impact several metrics, such as computation cost and analytics accuracy. In this paper, we investigate the joint configuration adjustment problem for video knobs and computation resources provided by the serverless platform. We propose an algorithm that can efficiently adapt configurations for video streams to address two key challenges in serverless-based video analytics systems, including the complex relationships between the configurations and the key performance metrics, and the dynamically best configuration. Our algorithm is developed based on Markov approximation to minimize the computation cost within an accuracy constraint. We have developed a prototype over AWS Lambda and conducted extensive experiments with real-world video streams.

In the service governance function of traffic management, how to design an efficient strategy for request distribution to minimize response time has attracted wide research interest. Generally, a traffic policy can be pre-set manually. However, such a static policy always performs terribly when the load changes dynamically. That is, Service Mesh cannot adaptively select the optimal policy when setting service version diversion and selecting instances on the service subset. To address this issue, in this paper, we designed an adaptive strategy based on split-flow to achieve global load balancing. Furthermore, we implement such a strategy by developing a plug-in named DTMA for Istio, a typical representative of Service Mesh. By obtaining the Service Mesh node’s topology and global instance load distribution in real-time, Istio updates the optimal split-flow weight and selects the suitable load balancing strategy. Extensive experimental results show that our algorithm can reduce the response time by nearly half and keep a load of nodes and instances stable compared with Istio’s native configuration. The optimization effect of minimizing the response time is achieved through real-time load balancing.","2690-5965","978-1-6654-7315-6","10.1109/ICPADS56603.2022.00089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10077895","Service Mesh;Traffic management;Real-Time;Load balancing;Istio","Automation;Source coding;Scalability;Microservice architectures;Elasticity;Load management;Real-time systems","","4","","25","IEEE","27 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So far, adopting cloud computing for time-critical applications and decreasing access delays to resources is difficult. Deep learning has been extensively employed to extract characteristics from complicated networks as artificial intelligence technology has advanced. On the other hand, deep learning models are often run in cloud computing data centres with tremendous processing resources. Conventional cloud computing systems primarily rely on the network, which has significant latency and security and privacy issues. One of the successful solutions is the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) paradigm, which brings cloud computing services closer to the edge network and uses available resources. Mobile edge computing places computer and storage nodes near mobile devices at the Internet's edge, leading to considerable savings in system operating time, memory cost, and power usage. Deep learning is used in mobile edge computing to forecast changes in demand based on daily patient behaviours. It also prepares the network by scaling up network resources as required.

The reliable functioning of energy management data platforms is essential for the efficient operation and performance of buildings, as well as the well-being of occupants. The fast-paced digital advances have aided this direction, but they have also created increased challenges for operation disruption mitigation and immutable services and outcomes. Data obtained from energy management systems frequently comprises highly sensitive and personal information. Consequently, access to such data, whether for reading purposes or for conducting experiments and research, must be strictly restricted and clearly defined. Through security frameworks data protection and information privacy, mitigation of risks and vulnerabilities can be ensured. In this paper, an end-to-end Security Framework is proposed for securing sensitive resources in energy management systems using Keycloak, OAuth2 and UMA 2 protocols as well as an extra security layer on top of the Keycloak, so as to enhance the overall security and avoid immediate interaction with Keycloak, which is the main user storage and access management component.

However, fulfilling the stringent low latency demands of uRLLC applications poses a significant challenge for 5G networks. Traditional central cloud-based architectures struggle to achieve these tight requirements, necessitating creative latency optimisation methods. Therefore, Edge computing emerges as a viable paradigm, with the potential to bring computational resources closer to end users and applications to achieve end-to-end latency of around 10 milliseconds (ms). In this paper, we propose an efficient architecture for minimising latency in 5G networks by moving the user plane function (UPF) to the network edge closer to the users, leveraging the control and user plane separation (CUPS) strategy. In addition, this paper further proposes the software-defined networking (SDN) based backhaul. Leveraging SDN in the backhaul network of 5G deployments allows operators to create dynamic, scalable, and efficient networks capable of serving a diverse variety of services and applications with varying performance needs. The experiment results from the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) compliant 5G testbed prove that the proposed architecture optimises the latency by 60%.

We are interested to quantify the impact of these patterns while considering heterogeneous workloads, thus supporting software architects in understanding the root causes of performance issues. We use queuing networks to build the performance models of the seven design patterns and extract quantitative insights from model-based performance analysis. Our performance models are flexible in their input parameterization and reusable in different application contexts. We find that most design patterns confirm the expectation of practitioners, and our experimental results assess the identified performance gains and pains.

The Fog Computing (FC) paradigm has emerged to deal with the limitations of traditional clouds since computational resources are placed at the edges of the network, aiming to decrease the latency expected by IoT devices and reduce the amount of data sent to the cloud. However, research challenges persist in FC since it is not a mature concept yet.

Furthermore, applications designed and deployed to leverage the cloud for data analytics and storage, with devices as data generators, face challenges in adapting to intermediate levels of the edge-cloud continuum (such as on-premise, near and far-edge). This paper presents a novel approach that uses a set of abstractions to conceptualize platform-independent applications. Applications are modeled as a composition of abstract services, which are independent of the place of distribution, be it edge or cloud, and specific platforms, and offer developers flexibility in the selection of services and providers during distribution, optimizing the use of resources and costs. Through detailed modeling, this paper uncovers how applications interact with abstract services, structured as workflows comprising interconnected tasks encompassing computation, communication, and storage. The interaction between these elements has a significant impact on both quality of service (QoS) and cost considerations, a key consideration in the design phase. Using such abstractions in modeling not only facilitates application development but also simplifies application deployment processes. A case study within the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) validates the modeling approach, illustrating how precise and abstract modeling of the application, independent of specific platforms, facilitates the development of real-world applications within the edge-cloud continuum.","2325-2944","979-8-3503-6944-1","10.1109/DCOSS-IoT61029.2024.00092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10621502","Edge Cloud Continuum;Service Composition;Abstract Design;Deployment Agnosticism;Requirements Analysis","Measurement;Cloud computing;Costs;Computational modeling;Heuristic algorithms;Quality of service;Task analysis","","2","","16","IEEE","12 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These federations (often referred to as the Cloud-Edge Continuum) are the foundation upon which most modern digital systems depend, and consume enormous amounts of energy. This consumption is becoming a critical issue as society's energy challenges grow, and is a great concern for power grids which must balance the needs of clouds against other users. The Continuum is highly dynamic, mobile, and complex; new methods to improve energy efficiency must be based on formal scientific models that identify and take into account a huge range of heterogeneous components, interactions, stochastic properties, and (potentially contradictory) service-level agreements and stakeholder objectives. Currently, few formal models of federated Cloud-Edge systems exist - and none adequately represent and integrate energy considerations (e.g. multiple providers, renewable energy sources, pricing, and the need to balance consumption over large-areas with other non-Cloud consumers, etc.). This paper conducts a systematic analysis of current approaches to modelling Cloud, Cloud-Edge, and federated Continuum systems with an emphasis on the integration of energy considerations. We identify key omissions in the literature, and propose an initial high-level architecture and approach to begin addressing these - with the ultimate goal to develop a set of integrated models that include data centres, edge devices, fog nodes, energy providers, software workloads, end users, and stakeholder requirements and objectives.

As the main consumers of energy, these growing data centers spend a lot of money on their power consumption every year. One of the most important consequences of the power production process is the increase in environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The power sector which is dependent on fossil fuels, is one of the main sources of carbon dioxide emissions in the world and plays a significant role in increasing greenhouse gas emissions which contribute to global warming and accelerated climate change. Therefore, the problem of enhancing and transforming the process of generation and consumption of energy in data centers and utilizing energy-efficient technologies has become more important. To overcome this problem, it is essential to integrate renewable energy as a clean source of energy, inexhaustible and always available, into data centers. In this article, we provide a taxonomy of the literature on methods of production, utilization, forecasting, and management of renewable energy integration into data centers.

Usually, the scheduling algorithm considers only a limited sample of the infrastructure nodes, typically obtained through random sampling. The sampling reduces the number of nodes, which need to be evaluated in the scheduling pipeline, making the scheduling process more saleable. Unfortunately, current sampling approaches become largely inefficient when the infrastructure is heterogeneous and specific, scarce node characteristics are required to successfully execute a workload. Computing continuum infrastructures are heterogeneous, hence, we need to re-think the sampling process to keep it viable at scale while also being able to identify and leverage the heterogeneity of the Edge-Cloud continuum resources. In this article, we present Intelligent Sampling - a novel technique for improving sampling in large-scale and heterogeneous infrastructures. We develop a model for any heterogeneous infrastructure. Based on this model, we provide a method to sample the infrastructure nodes more accurately, considering the specific task at hand. Finally, we leverage the Alibaba PAI dataset to show that our approach is 2.5x times more accurate compared with other state-of-the-art sampling mechanisms while retaining comparable performance and scalability.","2642-6587","979-8-3503-2239-2","10.1109/SOSE58276.2023.00024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10254740","Computing continuum;Intelligent sampling;Workloads scheduling;Heterogeneous infrastructure model","Service-oriented systems engineering;Scheduling algorithms;Computational modeling;Scalability;Pipelines;Heterogeneous networks;Complexity theory","","2","","40","IEEE","25 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, functions processing network packets have become responsible for a rapidly increasing portion of the datacenter tax. To tackle this problem, the industry has developed SmartNICs (SNICs) integrating conventional NICs with inexpensive and energy-efficient processors that can efficiently execute functions widely used by network-intensive datacenter applications. With such processors, the SNICs promise to reduce the total cost of ownership (TCO) for datacenters by increasing energy efficiency of servers and/or decreasing the number of expensive server CPU cores. In this paper, to make sense of using SNICs, we focus on analyzing energy efficiency of a server with an SNIC, especially under service level objective (SLO) constraints which matter for many datacenter applications. To this end, we not only measure the system-wide power consumption of a server but also devise a custom hardware setup that allows us to isolate the power consumption of the SNIC from that of the server. This helps us better understand the impact of using SNICs on energy efficiency of servers. Second, we take popular TCP/UDP, DPDK, and RDMA-based functions, and prepare them to run on an SNIC processor and a server CPU. Then, we measure maximum throughput, tail latency, system-wide energy efficiency of executing the functions on the SNIC processor and the server CPU, respectively. Lastly, based on analyses of the measurements, we make five key observations and three strategies to better use and design SmartNICs in the future.","2835-2238","979-8-3503-0317-9","10.1109/IISWC59245.2023.00025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10289567","","Industries;Program processors;Power demand;Power measurement;Finance;Tail;Throughput","","2","","84","IEEE","26 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Stateless frameworks are more robust and require no training, but are generally lower performance. In this paper, we propose a new framework that does not require a model, but does track a small amount of state in the form of recent power dynamics. We implement this idea and test it on a public cloud running both Spark and HPC jobs.

In this regard, network slicing (NS) and overall network softwarization technologies can play an essential role in addressing iEDs QoS and utility needs. In this work, we propose an optimal intelligent end-to-end resource allocation with network slicing in multi-tier SAGIN to maximize the network performance. We model the network depending on its service requirements. As the above optimization problem turns out to be NP-hard, we transform it into a stochastic game model and efficiently solve it through hierarchical multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (HMADRL). In particular, we decompose it into two parts, i.e., optimizing the mapping combined with slice adjustment and the resource allocation with association problem. Both problems are then solved using multi-agent DRL.

In some cases, the data that is captured at a given point has to be processed before moving to the next one. Drones can exploit nearby edge servers to offload the computation instead of performing it locally. However, doing this in a naive way can be suboptimal if servers have limited computing resources and drones have limited energy resources. In this paper, we propose a protocol and resource reservation scheme for each drone and edge server to decide, in a dynamic and fully decentralized way, whether to offload the computation and respectively whether to accept such an offloading requests, with the objective to evenly reduce the drones' mission times. We evaluate our approach through extensive simulation experiments, showing that it can significantly reduce the mission times compared to a no-offloading scenario by up to 26.2%, while outperforming an offloading schedule that has been computed offline by up to 7.4% as well as a purely opportunistic approach by up to 23.9%.","2325-2944","979-8-3503-4649-7","10.1109/DCOSS-IoT58021.2023.00043","European Union(grant numbers:101092912); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10257272","drones;computation offloading;edge computing;path planning;energy constraints;uncertainty;system dynamics","Schedules;Protocols;Energy resources;Machine learning;Sensors;Servers;Internet of Things","","1","","13","IEEE","27 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Queue sorting determines the deployment order of containers in the infrastructure, typically based on container priorities and resource requests. Optimizing these algorithms directly influences scheduling efficiency and overall application performance. This paper compares several schedulers and sorting algorithms, leveraging extensive benchmark tests conducted on the widely-used Kubernetes (K8s) platform.

However, with the development of the Internet of Things, data are collected, processed, and stored in a distributed manner, leading a new optimization paradigm for SAEAs. To make SAEAs adapt to these distributed DOPs, this paper employs the edge computing paradigm to develop a platform that provides technical support for SAEAs with distributed structures, named ECdo. Specifically, the platform utilizes KubeEdge, an open-source edge computing framework, to mount the cluster and combines microservice interface design with the containerization strategy to offer a flexible deployment approach for distributed SAEAs. In addition, an efficient and stable internal communication mechanism is designed for the interaction between distributed components within the platform. To demonstrate the application of ECdo, we take the examples of a class of distributed DOPs, in which the objective and constraints are expensive and need to be approximated by accumulated data. These problems are known as distributed and expensive constrained optimization problems (DECOPs). We implement a distributed SAEA on ECdo to address DECOPs in real-world scenarios. Experiments show that the ECdo can provide the expected implementation for distributed SAEAs with good network tolerance under tough network conditions.","2577-1655","979-8-3503-3702-0","10.1109/SMC53992.2023.10394009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10394009","edge computing;surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm;distributed optimization;expensive optimization","Training;Cloud computing;Privacy;Distributed databases;Evolutionary computation;Programming;Stability analysis","","1","","33","IEEE","29 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The experiment results demonstrated the effectiveness of FLOW for the real-world applications.","","979-8-3503-1995-8","10.1109/MOST57249.2023.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10210780","Multi-model federated learning;connected vehicle;client selection;model scheduling;geofencing","Training;Connected vehicles;Federated learning;Heuristic algorithms;Computational modeling;Clustering algorithms;Wheels","","1","","54","IEEE","14 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike traditional service invocation, configurations for governance need to be issued in the service mesh. However, we find that the control-plane traffic of governance is distributed in full by default, i.e., each service in the data plane receives all configurations. The vast majority of the configurations are redundant for a specific service. Hence, it is important and challenging to make the control plane aware of the calling relationships between services. In this paper, we propose a traffic management mechanism named DATM. Using this mechanism, the entire cluster can be dynamically controlled and services can be configured on demand. It is implemented through a dependency-aware controller and monitors. The controller first processes the information listened to by the monitors and then analyzes the connection between the metrics and the service requests through intelligent algorithms. Finally, the control traffic for regulating the control plane is generated. Our proposed mechanism is experimentally compared with the default strategy and existing work across a wide set of load scenarios in a testbed based on Istio service mesh and Kubernetes. Experimental results demonstrate that our mechanism can save the storage resources of a single agent by 40% to 60%, and the number of cluster updates can be greatly reduced. From the perspective of the whole cluster, the optimization results are even better.","2690-5965","978-1-6654-7315-6","10.1109/ICPADS56603.2022.00065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10077918","Service Mesh;Traffic Management;ConFigure On-demand;Cost Reduction","Measurement;Heuristic algorithms;Process control;Distributed databases;Clustering algorithms;Closed box;Aerospace electronics","","1","","25","IEEE","27 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Microservices are specialized components of an application that can be deployed and scaled individually, potentially replacing monolithic applications. To meet this demand, cloud providers offer function-as-a-service (FaaS) or serverless computing. Additionally, there is an increasing use of containerized environments in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. It has been shown that implementing serverless computing at the edge of an IoT network for executing tasks can reduce the overall execution time of these tasks. In cloud and edge computing environments, the infrastructure typically exhibits heterogeneity, and this heterogeneity can significantly impact the performance of different invocations of a FaaS function. This paper addresses infrastructure heterogeneity by partitioning a heterogeneous cluster into homogeneous pools based on similar resource characteristics and profiling function performance. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) a serverless architecture design that extends the function placement and load-balancing capabilities of current serverless platforms to effectively manage infrastructure heterogeneity, (2) a load-balancing approach that efficiently utilizes multi-core hardware, and (3) an implementation of the architecture, thereby evaluating the impact of the extended capabilities.","","979-8-3503-6941-0","10.1109/IoT60973.2023.10365354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10365354","Cloud Computing;Edge Computing;function-as-a-service (FaaS);Internet of Things (IoT);infrastructure heterogeneity","Multicore processing;Serverless computing;Microservice architectures;Computer architecture;Market research;Load management;Hardware","","1","","27","IEEE","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The decision for routing is made based on a weighted heuristic. The proposed algorithm, QLEN aims to improve three quality of service factors, namely L (load balancing efficiency), E (energy consumption) and N (network usage); hence the name QLEN. The importance of these parameters can be varied according to the application. This is done by adjusting the weights to suit the needs of the incoming tasks. For the default use case, the weights are tuned for the optimization of all three of the parameters. These optimal weights are calculated using stochastic gradient descent. QLEN is compared against fundamental load balancing algorithms such as Round Robin, Throttled Round Robin and Priority Based Load Balancing algorithm. The environment simulates a health monitoring application, using the iFogSim simulator. The results show that QLEN consistently outperforms the compared algorithms with respect to the targeted parameters. The efficiency of load distribution achieved by QLEN on average performs 1.69% better than all the three algorithms; at the same time showing 54.86% lesser network usage, 3413.33 MJ lesser energy consumption and 10.39% reduced redirection to the cloud.

The processor is designed to energy-efficiently execute network functions frequently used by datacenter applications. With such a processor, the SNIC has promised to notably improve the system-wide energy efficiency of datacenter servers. Nevertheless, the latest trend of integrating accelerators into server CPUs for these functions sparks a question on the SNIC processor’s superiority over a host processor (i.e., server CPU with accelerators) in system-wide energy efficiency, especially under given tail latency constraints. Answering this question, we first take an Intel Xeon processor, integrated with various accelerators (e.g., QuickAssist Technology), as a host processor, and then compare it to an NVIDIA BlueField-2 SNIC processor. This uncovers that (1) the host accelerator, coupled with a more powerful memory subsystem, can outperform the SNIC accelerator, and (2) the SNIC processor can improve system-wide energy efficiency only at low packet rates for most functions under tail latency constraints. To provide high system-wide energy efficiency without compromising tail latency at any packet rates, we propose HAL, consisting of a hardware-based load balancer and an intelligent load balancing policy implemented inside the SNIC. When HAL determines that the SNIC processor cannot efficiently process a given function beyond a specific packet rate, it limits the rate of packets to the SNIC processor and lets the host processor handle the excess. We implement a HAL-enabled SNIC with a commodity FPGA and a BlueField-2 SNIC, plug it into a commodity server, and run 10 popular network functions. Our evaluation shows that HAL can improve the system-wide energy efficiency and throughput of the server running these functions by 31% and 10%, respectively, without notably increasing the tail latency.","","979-8-3503-2658-1","10.1109/ISCA59077.2024.00051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10609665","","Memory management;Tail;Load management;Throughput;Market research;Energy efficiency;Servers","","1","","82","IEEE","1 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Probabilistic forecasting, in contrast to deterministic single-point estimators, can offer a different approach to resource allocation by quantifying the uncertainty of the generated predictions. This paper examines the cloud-native aspects of O-RAN together with the radio App (rApp) deployment options. The integration of probabilistic forecasting techniques as a rApp in O-RAN is also emphasized, along with case studies of real-world applications. Through a comparative analysis of forecasting models using the error metric, we show the advantages of Deep Autoregressive Recurrent network (DeepAR) over other deterministic probabilistic estimators. Furthermore, the simplicity of Simple-Feed-Forward (SFF) leads to a fast runtime but does not capture the temporal dependencies of the input data. Finally, we present some aspects related to the practical applicability of cloud-native O-RAN with probabilistic forecasting.","2575-4912","979-8-3503-4499-8","10.1109/EuCNC/6GSummit60053.2024.10597068","Horizon Europe; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10597068","Open RAN;6G;Probabilistic Forecasting;Cloud Native","Measurement;6G mobile communication;Open RAN;Predictive models;Probabilistic logic;Transformers;Resource management","","1","","15","IEEE","19 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Choi",Santa Clara University; Santa Clara University,2023 Fifth International Conference on Blockchain Computing and Applications (BCCA),"11 Dec 2023","2023","","","200","207","There is a growing interest in deploying blockchain, a distributed and decentralized immutable ledger, on alternate form of hardware to improve the performance, security, energy usage and hardware cost of blockchain. However, so far, the success in utilizing alternate form of hardware has not gained popularity due to the limited benefits of using proposed alternate hardware. For example, running blockchain on a dedicated hardware setup that is separate from the primary infrastructure, such as Raspberry Pi, has limited the energy, hardware and efficiency as you need to manage an entirely separate and dedicated hardware with additional setup, wiring and more. A recent advancement in networking brought a new type of network interface card (NIC) called SmartNIC that allows users to run more advanced and customized programs on a NIC. The main set of benefits of SmartNICs include increased programmability, increased security and increased hardware cost and energy efficiency, as it provides additional computing power to a device that already must be present in a server, and freeing the CPUs to perform other important tasks. Given such benefit, this paper focuses on running customized blockchain application, based on Proof of Work mechanism, on the SmartNIC that utilizes all its available resources, which helps in removing the dependency on expensive, dedicated and specialized hardware and at the same time reduce the hardware needs for running blockchain application. The results are promising as the processing time of Proof of Work based blockchain application on a SmartNIC showed up to 72% improvement when the host is experiencing high load, all the while eliminating the need to add miscellaneous hardware dedicated for blockchain.","","979-8-3503-3923-9","10.1109/BCCA58897.2023.10338942","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10338942","SmartNIC;Blockchain;Domain-specific hardware;Proof of work;Green computing","Wiring;Performance evaluation;Costs;Proof of Work;Hardware;Blockchains;Servers","","1","","24","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While there exist design patterns for microservices that are theoretically beneficial for ensuring performance (and anti-patterns that should be avoided), they do not always lead to the expected impact. Some designs are solutions for achieving quality properties other than performance, and while they might be categorized as anti-patterns in theory, their influence on system performance can be minimal, depending on the context. Architects find it hard to reason about these trade-offs and the impact that design decisions will have on performance before implementing them. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose an approach that enables rapid evaluation of high-level architectural models by combining both static and dynamic analysis. The static analysis identifies the design anti-patterns that are known to hinder system performance and guides the architect in reasoning about these design decisions. The approach then generates source code for the system under study based on the architectural design model for a subsequent dynamic analysis to assess whether the statically detected anti-patterns do indeed have a negative effect on the performance of the analyzed system.","2768-4288","978-1-6654-6459-8","10.1109/ICSA-C57050.2023.00044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10092669","microservices;design decisions;anti-patterns;performance testing","Analytical models;Software architecture;System performance;Source coding;Microservice architectures;Static analysis;Cognition","","1","","17","IEEE","24 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Compared to existing Kubernetes frameworks and scheduling procedures, the advantages of KOptim are: (i) it facilitates the configuration of container resources using Service Level Agreement (SLA) classes, and (ii) it optimizes the online scheduling of containers using a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) algorithm. In short, the main contribution of KOptim is to simplify Kubernetes scheduler optimization, as well as other issues related to container configuration and validation. In KOptim, we propose to configure and manage container resources using a new model with three SLA classes related to CPUs, memory, and storage space. Each SLA class has three Quality of Services (QoS): Premium, Advanced, and Best Effort. Using the KOptim SLA classes, users can select a range of values for a service instead of specifying a fixed amount of resources for each container. This is designed to help non-expert users who do not need to know exactly how many resources must be used to configure their containers easily. In the scheduling step, we suggest using a mechanism based on a multi-criteria decision algorithm that allows users to consider several criteria during the online scheduling decision. In summary, KOptim is a generic framework for Kubernetes distributions even K3s and MicroK8s which are adapted to Fog and Edge computing. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of our framework to improve performance in terms of runtime and energy consumption.","","979-8-3503-6460-6","10.1109/IPDPSW63119.2024.00159","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10596385","Container technology;Service Level Agreement;Online multi-criteria scheduling;Kubernetes ecosystem","Energy consumption;Processor scheduling;Computational modeling;Quality of service;Containers;MCDM;Resource management","","1","","34","IEEE","26 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An accurate measurement and prediction of airspace density is crucial for a better managed airspace, both strategically and tactically, yielding a higher level of automation and thereby reducing the air traffic controller’s workload. Although the prior approaches have been able to address the problem to some extent, data management and query processing of ever-increasing vast volume of air traffic data at high rates, for various analytics purposes such as predicting aircraft counts, still remains a challenge especially when only linear prediction models are used.In this paper, we present a novel data management and prediction system that accurately predicts aircraft counts for a particular airspace sector within the National Airspace System (NAS). The incoming Traffic Flow Management (TFM) data is streaming, big, uncorrelated and noisy. In the preprocessing step, the system continuously processes the incoming raw data, reduces it to a compact size, and stores it in a NoSQL database, where it makes the data available for efficient query processing. In the prediction step, the system learns from historical trajectories and uses their segments to collect key features such as sector boundary crossings, weather parameters, and other air traffic data. The features are fed into various regression models, including linear, non-linear and ensemble models, and the best performing model is used for prediction. Evaluation on an extensive set of real track, weather, and air traffic data including boundary crossings in the U.S. verify that our system efficiently and accurately predicts aircraft counts in each airspace sector.","2155-7209","979-8-3503-3357-2","10.1109/DASC58513.2023.10311134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10311134","System-Wide Information Management (SWIM);Big Data;Air Traffic Management (ATM);Airspace Capacity;Machine Learning (ML)","Density measurement;Atmospheric modeling;Query processing;Predictive models;Aerospace electronics;Aircraft navigation;Trajectory","","1","","48","IEEE","10 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One main optimization of our method is to maximize the reuse of the originally allocated resources so that the disruption to the running job can be minimized. The scaling procedure is coordinated among nodes through remote procedure calls on Kubernetes for deploying workloads in the cloud. We evaluate our approach using one synthetic benchmark and two production-level MPI-based HPC applications - GRO-MACS and CM1. Our results demonstrate that the benefits of adapting the allocated resources depend on the workload characteristics. In the tested cases, a properly chosen scaling point for increasing resources during execution achieved up to 2x speedup.

Often, resource and power management techniques, such as elastic scaling and power capping, are handled independently, leading to conflicts and sub-optimal power-performance trade-offs. To tackle this issue, we introduce SLO-Power, a system that coordinates the resource and power scaling techniques to achieve power savings while adhering to service level objectives (SLOs), such as tail latency constraints. Our approach employs a combination of analytic queuing models and feedback-driven techniques to jointly allocate resources and power to cloud applications in an SLO and power-aware manner. We implement a prototype of our system and evaluate it using realistic workloads to demonstrate its ability to harmonize elastic and power scaling, enabling enhanced resource utilization and reduced power consumption while ensuring the application performance. Our findings indicate that SLO-Power achieves exceptional power and resource efficiency, approaching near-optimal power-efficiency levels at 90%, all while preventing SLO violations. Furthermore, compared to state-of-the-art solutions, SLO-Power demonstrates lower P95 latency, accompanied by a 12% reduction in resource usage.","2993-2114","979-8-3503-9566-2","10.1109/CCGrid59990.2024.00025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10701414","Elastic Scaling;Power Capping;Web Services;Application SLO","Analytical models;Power demand;Web services;Power system management;Prototypes;Tail;Resource management;Time factors;Servers;Queueing analysis","","1","","47","IEEE","8 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Vehicles release toxic gases, as they are ideal in traffic thus the number of pollutants gets increased. Smart parking systems help with these problems. They reduce traffic congestion which leads to less environmental pollution and saves fuel. A cloud-based parking system has been proposed, but it requires high latency and high bandwidth. Fog Computing gives us a better solution than cloud computing. With the help of fog computing smart car parking systems, the proposed model can clear all these issues. The driver gets information about the parking spots with minimal latency and energy consumption. By guiding the drivers where the parking spot is free it uses the space optimally. It also reduces the need to expand the parking area since land acquisition in urban areas is tough. A latency-reducing approach was developed using iFogSim and metrics like latency, total energy consumed, and total time taken were considered for a comparative analysis between the fog environment and the cloud environment. The developed fog-based system demonstrated better results than the cloud-based approach.","","979-8-3503-6178-0","10.1109/IC-CGU58078.2024.10530757","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10530757","Cloud Computing;Fog Computing;iFogSim;Latency;Urban-Parking","Measurement;Cloud computing;Pollution;Urban areas;Ubiquitous computing;Real-time systems;Fuels","","1","","20","IEEE","22 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the voluminous, dynamic, and heterogeneous nature of IoT traffic imposes complexities on the problems of network flow classification, network traffic analysis, and accurate quantification of the network requirements, thereby making the provisioning of 5G network slices across the application mix a challenging problem. To address these needs, we propose a novel network traffic classification approach that consists of a pipeline that combines Principal Component Analysis (PCA), with KMeans clustering and Hellinger distance. PCA is applied as the first step to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of features while preserving as much of the original information as possible. This significantly reduces the runtime of KMeans, which is applied as the second step. KMeans, being an unsupervised approach, eliminates the need to label data which can be cumbersome, error-prone, and time-consuming. In the third step, a Hellinger distance-based recursive KMeans algorithm is applied to merge similar clusters toward identifying the optimal number of clusters. This makes the final clustering results compact and intuitively interpretable within the context of the problem, while addressing the limitations of traditional KMeans algorithm, such as sensitivity to initialization and the requirement of manual specification of the number of clusters. Evaluation of our approach on a real-world IoT dataset demonstrates that the pipeline can compactly represent the dataset as three clusters. The service properties of these clusters can be easily inferred and directly mapped to different types of slices in the 5G network.","2693-8340","979-8-3503-2281-1","10.1109/SMARTCOMP58114.2023.00034","Siemens; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10207621","Network traffic classification;Unsupervised Machine Learning;Clustering;5G;Dynamic network slicing;Traffic analysis;Machine Learning","Sensitivity;Runtime;5G mobile communication;Network slicing;Pipelines;Clustering algorithms;Telecommunication traffic","","1","","20","IEEE","7 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For scalable provisioning of microservices, recently proposed methods frequently need a priori information on the microservice type, computational capacity, and other parameters. In the presence of such restrictions, the present methods need to face lower quality of experience for mission-critical and resource-hungry applications. In this paper, we study the problem of microservice provisioning for mobile edge computing, and we propose an adaptive and scalable solution. The core of our optimal microservice differentiation scheme is ASAP, a microservice-level abstraction for the orchestration of network resources. ASAP provides adaptive and scalable microservice provisioning by minimizing microservice delay, while maximizing the network throughput. With a prototype tested over a local testbed and trace-driven simulations, we show how ASAP increases throughput compared to other solutions based on the executions of microservices at the edge.","","978-3-903176-56-0","10.23919/WONS57325.2023.10062045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062045","","Wireless communication;Adaptive systems;Multi-access edge computing;Mission critical systems;Microservice architectures;Prototypes;Throughput","","1","","23","","13 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In edge computing environments, resource allocation is essential for ensuring the best possible resource utilization while still satisfying application requirements. Traditional resource allocation algorithms, however, struggle to effectively capture the uncertainties and ambiguity associated with resource availability and application needs because of the dynamic and varied nature of edge environments. This research offers a fuzzy logic-based method for planning to allocate resources in edge computing. Fuzzy logic offers a flexible and understandable framework for modeling and reasoning with imperfect and ambiguous data. The suggested method offers a more reliable and adaptable resource allocation system that can successfully address the uncertainties present in edge computing by utilizing fuzzy logic. The resource allocation process incorporates fuzzy membership functions to capture the vagueness of resource availability and application requirements. Fuzzy rules are defined to map the linguistic variables representing resource availability, application demands, and performance objectives to appropriate resource allocation decisions. The fuzzy inference engine then utilizes these rules to make intelligent decisions regarding resource allocation, considering the fuzzy inputs and the system's predefined objectives.","","979-8-3503-4488-2","10.1109/ICAIHC59020.2023.10431439","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10431439","Fuzzy Logic;Edge Computing;Latency aware;Resource Allocation","Fuzzy logic;Uncertainty;Heuristic algorithms;User experience;Planning;Resource management;Edge computing","","1","","23","IEEE","16 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the major advantages of edge computing is that edge data centers are usually much closer to users compared to traditional cloud data centers. Therefore, it is commonly believed that for developers of latency-sensitive applications, they can effectively reduce the overall end-to-end latency by simply transitioning from a cloud deployment to an edge deployment. However, as recent work has shown, the performance of an edge deployment is vulnerable to a couple of factors which under many practical scenarios can lead to edge servers providing worse end-to-end response time than cloud servers. This phenomenon is referred to as edge performance inversion. In this paper, we propose resource allocation and workload scheduling algorithms that actively prevent edge performance inversion. Our algorithms, named INVAR, are based on queueing theory results and optimization techniques. Evaluation results show that INVAR can find a near-optimal solution that outperforms the performance of a cloud deployment by an adjustable margin.

In case there is a requirement for an enhanced throughput in a rural area (e.g., users requesting IoT applications with strict QoS requriements), a potential solution is to place several UAV s over the same area, thus maximizing the offered throughput.

It empowers optimization-driven transformations of metrics, tailored to evolving resource availability and application requirements. This paper demonstrates how PMF enables various transformations for dynamic and fine-grained metric collection. We also showcase the capability of PMF for dynamically tuning the frequency of metrics to reduce the WAN cost in edge environments. Our experiments show that PMF performs at par with state-of-the- art techniques in terms of metric processing capability, with 10X lesser resource utilization. We envision PMF to usher in an era of lightweight programmability for observability platforms.

At every moment, there is a large amount of data such as power generation, electricity consumption, and equipment operating parameters that need to be processed. Artificial intelligence platforms need to have efficient data processing capabilities to meet the needs of real-time scheduling, otherwise scheduling decisions may be delayed due to data processing delays. Therefore, this article introduces cloud native technology to design an artificial intelligence platform for power dispatching. Cloud native technology supports distributed storage systems, dispersing data across multiple nodes to avoid the problem of insufficient capacity on a single storage device. Using this technology, MapReduce computing, HDFS distributed storage and other services are packaged into an independent and portable container image, and deployed in a Kubernetes cluster to achieve dynamic allocation and scaling of power resources. A data fusion module based on artificial intelligence algorithm design platform. Based on this, design a power dispatch model and introduce particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the model.

They are positioned everywhere from our largest cities to the bottom of our oceans, and often necessitate significant financial resources and labor to create and deploy. These properties make correctness of edge deployments simultaneously extremely important and difficult to verify a priori. In the past decade, a series of IoT and cloud testbeds have emerged to facilitate this testing. They provide users with access to resources and, less often, sensors that can be used to emulate workloads before deployment. While developers can use these resources to verify the correctness of their configurations, often users would like to “right-size” their deployments - that is, to find a minimal resource configuration that guarantees correctness - to decrease cost and prevent over-provisioning. The current suite of cloud and IoT testbeds does not provide this capability. We present Righteous, an automatic deployment right-sizing tool for edge deployments. Righteous treats configuration as a hyperparameter optimization problem, testing hyperparameter combinations to find a near-optimal configuration as quickly as possible. Righteous uses a new optimization algorithm, informed Pareto Simulated Annealing (iPSA) to find near-optimal configurations faster than other leading approaches. We use Righteous in conjunction with the PROWESS testbed to optimize a drone swarm deployment workload. Our results demonstrate that Righteous configurations use up to 3.5X less resources than those identified by leading hyperparameter tuning and resource allocation techniques, and does so up to 76.3X faster.","2837-4827","979-8-3503-7828-3","10.1109/SEC62691.2024.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10818213","resource allocation;edge computing;optimization;UAV","Software algorithms;Urban areas;Simulated annealing;Hyperparameter optimization;Software;Sensors;Resource management;Optimization;Tuning;Testing","","","","51","IEEE","1 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this respect, Graph Neural Networks (GNN)s are gaining attention in the networking domain thanks to their ability to process data based on close to real modeling of networks as a graph. In this paper, we develop a GNN framework of intent-based networks that takes the network information as inputs and predicts the specific key performance indicators (KPIs) of intents.

Most prominently limited crew size, limits on crew time and utilization, as well as the costs of 24/7/365 operations are the main drivers for innovations towards increased autonomy. Furthermore, in the future, when considering destinations beyond lunar orbit, signal delay simply prevents the conventional operational concept of real-time monitoring and control for crewed missions. To overcome those challenges, this paper will introduce METIS, the Mars Exploration Telemetry-driven Information System. METIS is a novel intelligent assistant enabling autonomous operations of crewed spacecraft based on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). METIS is currently being developed at the Columbus Control-Center (Col-CC), which is part of the German Space Operations Center (GSOC). On behalf of the European Space Agency (ESA), Col-CC is responsible for the operation of the Columbus module of the International Space Station (ISS). Columbus was launched on February 7, 2008, docked to the ISS a few days later on February 11 and has been a part of the ISS since then. It is the basis on which METIS is developed. The assistant is designed after John L. Boyds OODA (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act) loop for human decision making, where each function in the model is developed as an individual computerized agent. This paper will introduce the high-level system architecture of this multi-agent-system (MAS), as well as human interaction embedded in the system. Furthermore, we will show each of the agents in greater detail, their functions and the interaction between the agents. Since some agents rely on machine learning (ML) from the field of artificial intelligence (AI) we use multiple data sources from the Columbus module, including but not limited to on-board telemetry, operational data files (ODFs, i.e. procedures), and anomaly reports, to train and test the system. We will highlight how these data sources are brought together and the database we deploy to enable access to the data in a machine-readable format. Since METIS is intended to be used by both ground personnel, as well as on-board crew, we will show how METIS is planned to be utilized within Col-CC and on-board. For this we envision a step-wise approach, where METIS is first used and tested in conjunction with the Columbus simulator to perform certain ground and on-board activities and react to a set of known anomalies. In this first step ground controllers will still be heavily involved in development, to identify areas that need further improvements and further increase the capabilities of the system. This work represents a significant step towards full crew autonomy by supporting quick and reliable decision making in the highly dynamic environment that is human space exploration. AI/ML enabled solutions to new and old challenges have the potential to revolutionize the space sector and METIS represents one possible contribution to make space more accessible to humans, increase system reliability, reduce cost of operations and help prepare for deep space exploration beyond lunar orbit.","1095-323X","979-8-3503-0462-6","10.1109/AERO58975.2024.10521154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10521154","","Space vehicles;Costs;Soft sensors;Decision making;Systems architecture;Real-time systems;Orbits","","","","39","IEEE","13 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These applications are often prone to failures, since they have many independent services deployed on heterogeneous environments. When employed “correctly”, observability can help developers identify and troubleshoot faults quickly. However, instrumenting and configuring the observability of a microservice application is not trivial but tool-dependent and tied to costs. Architects need to understand observability-related trade-offs in order to weigh between different observability design alternatives. Still, these architectural design decisions are not supported by systematic methods and typically just rely on “professional intuition”. In this paper, we argue for a systematic method to arrive at informed and continuously assessable observability design decisions. Specifically, we focus on fault observability of cloud-native microservice applications, and turn this into a testable and quantifiable property. Towards our goal, we first model the scale and scope of observability design decisions across the cloud-native stack. Then, we propose observability metrics which can be determined for any microservice application through so-called observability experiments. We present a proof-of-concept implementation of our experiment tool Oxn. Oxn is able to inject arbitrary faults into an application, similar to Chaos Engineering, but also possesses the unique capability to modify the observability configuration, allowing for the assessment of design decisions that were previously left unexplored. We demonstrate our approach using a popular open source microservice application and show the trade-offs involved in different observability design decisions.","2835-7043","979-8-3503-5916-9","10.1109/ICSA59870.2024.00015","European Union(grant numbers:101070186); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10592667","Observability;Microservices;Software Architecture;Software Design Trade-offs","Fault diagnosis;Systematics;Costs;Software architecture;Instruments;Pipelines;Microservice architectures","","","","30","IEEE","24 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents an effective and tunable node placement strategy based on a genetic algorithm to address the optimization problem of deploying edge and fog nodes. The task assignment for this algorithm involves two key components: first, it identifies the nearest node to a given user; second, it assesses the node’s capacity to ensure it has sufficient frequency resources to handle the assigned tasks.

However, the energy sector has yet to fully leverage these advancements. The primary associated challenge is the acquisition and processing of energy data which can be subject to stringent regulations imposed by data protection laws. This can hinder access to energy data for IoT service providers focusing on energy optimizations and analytics, thus hampering the development of energy IoT services. This challenge is particularly pertinent to manufacturing scenarios where energy-efficient processes are crucial for sustainable development. For example, in the context of battery production, energy data and services can be critical for optimizing processes and enhancing the manufacturing efficiency of battery cells. Thus, energy data can be essential for achieving sustainability and reducing costs as well as ensuring the effective use of energy resources, and minimizing the environmental footprint.

In embedded systems, hypervisors are increasingly used to separate sensitive real-time tasks from best-effort applications. To take advantage of hypervisors at the application level as well, there is an emerging trend to split large applications into multiple guest domains to make the software easier to analyze and maintain. However, having more partitions leads to increased communication overhead between guest domains, increasing the impact of latencies on performance. In this article, we propose a framework for Inter-Domain Communication (IDC) to tackle these issues by reducing IDC latencies. It is built upon established open-source implementations of the VIRTIO and RPMsg specifications, allowing to reuse existing drivers for guest OS or bare-metal software. We can show latency improvements of up to 3x compared to UDP communication between two guests, even faster than UDP communication using the loopback interface within one Linux guest. Splitting applications into separate guest domains is discussed, as a trace-off between communication latency and computational complexity exists. Further a service-oriented example application is analyzed, where our approach can lead to improvements through inherent concurrency. In addition, we demonstrate how to extend the original peer-to-peer scheme with a router component to allow multiple guests to exchange data.","2771-3075","979-8-3503-9361-3","10.1109/MCSoC60832.2023.00057","Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10387919","Hypervisor;inter-domain communication;low latency;VIRTIO;mixed-critical systems","Virtual machine monitors;Protocols;Multicore processing;Software;Real-time systems;Peer-to-peer computing;Security","","","","19","IEEE","17 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traversing adversary-controlled infrastructure allows DOD’s adversaries to recognize, disrupt, or extract intelligence even from encrypted communications. The resulting arms race of obfuscation vs intelligence techniques has an inherent limitation: with each new obfuscation, DOD can never know if it fools the adversary, or if the adversary is simply lulling DOD into a false sense of security.We believe the next great capability leap for operating through commercial networks will likely come from sophisticated analytics that provide situational awareness of the threats within the communications infrastructure, and implementations that dynamically route communications along benign paths. These systems will restructure communication paths to avoid adversary-controlled infrastructure within the cellular networks and the broader Internet, adding depth to existing DOD defenses and keeping communications unobservable by the adversary.In this paper, we describe our vision for this emerging conceptual framework. We first describe the threat model for DOD communications and use cases that motivate our approach. We then discuss specific threats for each component of the cellular communication infrastructure–—radio access network, mobile core, and Internet–—and our vision for securing communications against those threats. For the radio access network and Internet components, we also describe proofs-of-concept for our proposed approaches, demonstrating their feasibility.","2155-7586","979-8-3503-7423-0","10.1109/MILCOM61039.2024.10773880","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10773880","mobile;wireless;security;5G;emerging concepts","Threat modeling;Privacy;Weapons;Routing protocols;Real-time systems;US Department of Defense;Internet;Substrates;Research and development;Radio access networks","","","","20","IEEE","6 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, overclocking can significantly degrade component lifetime, increase power draw, and cause power capping events, eventually diminishing the performance benefits. In this paper, we characterize the impact of overclocking on cloud workloads by studying their profiles from production deployments. Based on the characterization insights, we propose SmartOClock, the first distributed overclocking management platform specifically designed for cloud environments. SmartOClock is a workload-aware scheme that relies on power predictions to heterogeneously distribute the power budgets across its servers based on their needs and then enforce budget compliance locally, per-server, in a decentralized manner. SmartOClock reduces the tail latency by 9%, application cost by 30% and total energy consumption by 10% for latencysensitive microservices on a 36-server deployment. Simulation analysis using production traces show that SmartOClock reduces the number of power capping events by up to 95% while increasing the overclocking success rate by up to 62%.

However, the generation and distribution of energy have far-reaching impacts on the environment. To mitigate these impacts, sustainable energy management has become a priority for many countries. Edge computing has emerged as a promising technology that can aid in sustainable energy management. This paper explores the role of edge computing in sustainable energy management with an emphasis on the environmental aspect. The paper examines the concept of edge computing and how it can be applied to sustainable energy management. The paper also highlights the environmental benefits of using edge computing in sustainable energy management. The paper concludes that edge computing can play a significant role in sustainable energy management, particularly in mitigating environmental impacts. Complex interactions between edge devices, edge servers, and cloud data centres may explain why edge computing has received less attention to energy efficiency than cloud data centres. Reaching energy efficiency goals with edge computing requires thorough testing of edge devices, edge servers, and cloud data centres. This paper's goal is to give readers a synopsis of edge computing's history and evolution. We then shifted our focus to the fundamentals of edge computing. The study concludes with a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of edge computing.","","979-8-3503-0448-0","10.1109/IC3I59117.2023.10398093","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10398093","Cloud;Fog;Edge;Internet of Things;Energy Efficiency;Energy Management","Data centers;Renewable energy sources;Energy efficiency;Wind turbines;Servers;Optimization;Edge computing","","","","39","IEEE","26 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this workshop paper, we make the following contributions. First, we carry out the first assessment of recently proposed advanced forecasting techniques by the AI community, namely DLinear and PatchTST, when applied to the prediction of mobile traffic load and number of users connected to a single Base Station (BS). We compare these techniques with the well-known Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) models that are widely adopted in mobile network tasks. Second, we analyze the accuracy tradeoff of these Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques for single-and multi-step prediction horizons. Third, we profile the operation of all these black-box predictors with an EXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) lens by using AIChronoLens, a new tool that links legacy XAI explanations with the temporal properties of the input sequences. We find that DLinear excels in single-step horizon predictions while PatchTST and LSTM are more accurate in multi-step horizon predictions. Our XAI study reveals that, unlike PatchTST and LSTM, DLinear focuses its prediction decisions on a few key samples of the input sequences, which ultimately lets it match the ground truth closely.","2833-0587","979-8-3503-8447-5","10.1109/INFOCOMWKSHPS61880.2024.10620742","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10620742","","Accuracy;Explainable AI;Conferences;Time series analysis;Telecommunication traffic;Open RAN;Predictive models","","","","25","IEEE","13 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the implementation of China’s “plant-grid separation and competitive bidding for Internet access”, the competition among power producers has become increasingly intense, and power producers are facing serious challenges. To win in the fierce power market, it is necessary to continuously adopt new technologies in the production process, upgrade the original equipment, improve the safe operation coefficient of the equipment, and make it work better. The most important thing is to put people in the first place, improve the management level of the enterprise, plug the loopholes in the management, and gain benefits from the management.

These devices generate a vast amount of data that needs to be processed and analyzed, which can be computationally expensive and energy-intensive. To address this issue, fog computing has been introduced as a paradigm that offloads computation from IoT devices to nearby fog and cloud servers, thereby reducing the energy consumption of these devices. Fog computing is a decentralized architecture that brings computation and data storage closer to the edge of the network, enabling faster and more efficient data processing in IoT devices. Offloading, in the context of fog computing architecture, refers to the process of transferring computationally intensive tasks from IoT devices to fog or cloud servers. Offloading computational tasks from IoT devices to fog servers can significantly reduce the energy consumption of these devices. By offloading tasks to more powerful servers at the edge of the network, IoT devices can conserve energy and prolong battery life. This paper explores the concept of offloading in fog computing architecture as a means to achieve energy savings in IoT devices.","","979-8-3503-8106-1","10.1109/EEE-AM58328.2023.10395179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10395179","Fog computing;Cloud computing;Internet of Things;Offloading;Energy","Energy consumption;Energy conservation;Computer architecture;Internet of Things;Servers;Task analysis;Edge computing","","","","12","IEEE","25 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present SurgeGuard, a decentralized resource controller for microservice applications specifically designed to guard application QoS during surges in load and network latency. SurgeGuard uses the key insight that for rapid detection and effective management of QoS violations, the controller must be aware of any available slack in latency and communication patterns between microservices within a task-graph. Our experiments show that for the workloads in DeathStarBench, SurgeGuard on average reduces the combined violation magnitude and duration by $61.1 \%$ and $93.7 \%$, respectively, compared to the well-known Parties and Caladan algorithms, and requires $8 \%$ fewer resources than Parties.","","979-8-3503-5291-7","10.1109/SC41406.2024.00103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10793138","Cloud computing;microservices;serverless;quality-of-service;resource management;datacenters","Costs;High performance computing;Microservice architectures;Quality of service;Computer architecture;Resource management;Surges","","","","35","IEEE","24 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To mitigate these issues, our work proposes the use of two cellular links from different providers prioritised according to Quality of Service (QoS) prediction.

Edge computing has emerged as a viable solution to address this challenge. In this study, we propose an Internet of Things (IoT) signal processing framework that is combined with distributed edge nodes. The objective is to improve data transmission efficiency and real-time performance. Firstly, in consideration of the constrained resources of edge devices, we have devised lightweight preprocessing algorithms, including frequency domain filtering based on Fourier transform and a denoising algorithm based on wavelet transform, with the objective of reducing the noise and redundant information present in the original signal. Subsequently, the adaptive compressed sensing technology was employed to compress the preprocessed signal, which resulted in a notable reduction in the bandwidth requirement for data transmission. Subsequently, in order to fully utilise the computing capabilities of edge nodes, we introduce a multi-task learning collaborative computing model. The model permits the sharing of computing tasks between multiple edge nodes, facilitates data collaboration between edge nodes through federated learning, and reduces computing redundancy and communication overhead. The experimental phase employs the Google Edge TPU Dataset to evaluate the dataset pertinent to the Internet of Things.

The current architecture of IoT is mainly centralized and single-point controlled; thereby opening up privacy and security lapses. Several approaches have favoured advanced data encryption to preserve privacy during transmission or storage. The debilitating challenges of IoT systems sparingly reported in previous works include: security of physical/logical components; software/hardware interoperability; high energy requirements; low processing/storage capacity, and network architecture/scalability. This paper comparatively studied encryption modes of Chaining Block Code (CBC) and Galois Counter Mode (GCM) based on hybrid algorithm of SHA1-256 and AES246 (known as SHA-AES scheme) towards preserving privacy of IoT data. The outcomes revealed that, the SHA-AES scheme based on CBC was better in terms of speed - encryption (8.34%) and decryption (43.42%); storage consumption - secret key sizes (50.00%) and ciphertext sizes (26.88%) against GCM. This implies that, the GCM approach offers the highest privacy protection but, less effective due to sluggish speed and high memory utilization. Also, strong cryptographic schemes interleaved with CBC and GCM hardening schemes offered improved confusion state, diffusion state, complexity, and performances. Future works could consider modifying the complex processes of GCM approach by minimizing key generation time to support resource-constrained devices.","","979-8-3503-2478-5","10.1109/SEB-SDG57117.2023.10124512","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10124512","CBC;GCM;cryptography;lightweight;privacy;memory consumption;speed;IoT;security status;encryption mode","Smart agriculture;Wireless communication;Privacy;Data privacy;Memory management;Hardware;Encryption","","","","41","IEEE","22 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Platforms accelerate the development and deployment of DTs and services and ensure their resilient operation in order to capture especially all relevant shop-floor information, for example to aggregate PCFs, CCFs, and DPPs or to report on sustainability - automatically. However, platform operators should in particular avoid cloud provider lock-ins to be able to react flexibly to use case requirements at any time. The technology must be manageable and costs must be controllable. The aim is to achieve a break-even point between security, costs, future viability and controllability, short implementation time and motivated use. Such requirements can currently only be met with cloud infrastructures. An agnostic design ensures that switching infrastructures is possible and can be done both securely and quickly.

To achieve the efficiency, load forecasting and elastic scaling have become crucial technologies for dynamically adjusting cloud resources to meet user demands and minimizing resource waste. However, existing prediction-based methods lack comprehensive analysis and integration of load characteristics across different time scales. For instance, long-term trend analysis helps reveal long-term changes in load and resource demand, thereby supporting proactive resource allocation over longer periods, while short-term volatility analysis can examine short-term fluctuations in load and resource demand, providing support for real-time scheduling and rapid response. In response to this, our research introduces TempoScale, which aims to enhance the comprehensive understanding of temporal variations in cloud workloads, enabling more intelligent and adaptive decision-making for elastic scaling. TempoScale utilizes the Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise algorithm to decompose time-series load data into multiple Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) and a Residual Component (RC). First, we integrate the IMF, which represents both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations, into the time series prediction model to obtain intermediate results. Then, these intermediate results, along with the RC, are transferred into a fully connected layer to obtain the final result. Finally, this result is fed into the resource management system based on Kubernetes for resource scaling. Our proposed approach can reduce the Mean Square Error by 5.80% to 30.43% compared to the baselines, and reduce the average response time by 5.58% to 31.15%. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in reducing violations of service-level objectives and providing better performance in terms of resource utilization.","2159-6190","979-8-3503-6853-6","10.1109/CLOUD62652.2024.00030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10643916","cloud native;load prediction;auto-scaling;deep learning;mode decomposition;transformer","Cloud computing;Fluctuations;Time series analysis;Noise;Predictive models;Market research;Prediction algorithms","","","","29","IEEE","28 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we focus on designing scalable edge stream processing workflows in real-world IoT deployments where performance and privacy are key concerns. Initial efforts have revealed that privacy policy execution/enforcement at the edge for intensive workloads is prohibitively expensive.

The majority of traditional clustering mechanisms are not competent to resource elasticity over multiple IoT systems and hence, handling load distribution effectively underutilizes the resources. To address the increasing complexities and constraints of modern IoT systems, adaptive mechanisms are required to implement virtual clustering, which can dynamically optimize performance and resource utilization by responding to real-time network changes and device heterogeneity.The article proposes the design and performance evaluation of adaptive virtual clustering methods tailored to the requirements of emerging IoT edge systems with dynamic environments. The goal is to optimize resource allocation, balance load, and enhance the overall system performance by deploying virtual clusters with the potential of adapting the best to changing network loads as well as device heterogeneity.We developed a multistep approach that combined state-of-the-art clustering algorithms, the K-means and agglomerative clustering, to our insight of Amdahl’s law using meta learning strategies. There are 4 architecture layers in our system: physical device layer, cluster management layer, coordination layer and virtual group. This paper revisits KPIs such as Silhouette Coefficient, Davies-Bouldin Index and Calinski-Harabasz Index under different network loads and performance of the device being considered.The proposed methods achieved better performance than existing clustering algorithms, particularly in high network traffic scenarios. In competitive testing, adaptive virtual clusters with up to 10% better in total performance over traditional clusters at full network load through smart node allocation and leveraging of the virtual memory for better load balancing.Adaptive virtual clustering appears to be a promising fit for the challenges posed by dynamic IoT edge environments. This limber approach yields improved in network efficiency, load distribution and overall network performance. Future work should focus on optimizing these adaptive clustering approaches for extreme network conditions, such as high device churn and congested IoT environments. Additionally, the integration of digital twin technologies and real-time adaptive machine learning models could further improve system responsiveness and performance in highly dynamic settings.","2305-7254","978-952-65246-2-7","10.23919/FRUCT64283.2024.10749877","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10749877","IoT;Edge Computing;Virtual Clustering;Adaptive Methods;Resource Optimization;Load Balancing;Heterogeneous Devices;Dynamic Systems;Network Performance;Clustering Algorithms","Performance evaluation;Adaptation models;Adaptive systems;Heuristic algorithms;Clustering methods;Scalability;Clustering algorithms;Real-time systems;Resource management;Indexes","","","","24","","13 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The inaugural INGR was released in 2020 and its focus was primarily on the evolution of 5G networks. The intention of the 2021 INGR Edition was to take a more end-to-end perspective that included integrating future network technologies and establishing a transdisciplinary framework and a predictive model for mobile networks. This 2022 INGR Edition broadened applications of the transdisciplinary framework, progressed each technology and system challenge while interworking with other. This 2023 Edition focuses on the beyond 5G horizon, the standardization and technologies that might enable it and 6G. All working groups in the INGR have examined the technologies and systems over three-, five-, and ten-year time periods. It is expected that this approach will better reveal the challenges, possible solutions and opportunities that are likely to exist in network deployments over varying timelines.","2770-7679","979-8-3503-2458-7","10.1109/FNWF58287.2023.10520544","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10520544","","Industries;5G mobile communication;Standards organizations;Organizations;Machine learning;Predictive models;Market research;Energy efficiency;Socioeconomics;Satellite communications","","","","0","IEEE","13 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Use cases driving this transition for 5G networks focus on the need to support heterogeneous traffic such as enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC), and Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC). On the software and control side, 5G and beyond networks are enabled through Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technologies and leverage the merging of communication and computing. Although not yet in the standardization stage, early thinking on 6G networks focuses on the convergence of physical, human, and digital worlds, including support for: ■ digital twinning (tight synchronization between the physical world and the twin), ■ immersive communication (support of pervasive haptics), ■ cognition (awareness of human intentions, desires, and mood), and ■ connected intelligence (trusted AI everywhere with interaction between virtual representations). All this also needs to be realized in sustainable fashion [1]. With the deployment of novel applications and the expected increase in their usage and demand, the scope of innovation within future networks will be governed by: (a) limitations and boundaries of available resources; (b) limitations of the adaptability of legacy solutions (scalability and flexibility); (c) limitations of available decision making entities (network slice orchestrators and SDN controllers will not be enough); and (d) lack of intelligent management and control solutions for multi-variate optimization. Technologies are available for efficient use and self-adaptive optimization of resources using enablers such as AI-powered autonomic control loops. With ever-increasing complexity expected for beyond-5G networks, there is a necessity for novel design, planning and operations paradigms. There is a need for assessment of legacy tools versus new Artificial Intelligence solutions for applicability to systems optimization, and a need for introduction of novel methods to model and study the behavior of highly complex systems developed for the realization of 5G and beyond networks.

The focus is on the computing infrastructures, such as hyper-scale cloud datacenters, that consume significant power, thus producing increasing amounts of carbon emissions. Our goal is to (1) optimize the usage of green energy sources (e.g., solar energy), which is desirable but expensive and relatively unstable, and (2) continuously reduce the use of fossil fuels, which have a lower cost but a significant negative societal impact. Meanwhile, cloud datacenters strive to meet their customers’ requirements, e.g., service-level objectives (SLOs) in application latency or throughput, which are impacted by infrastructure resilience and availability. We propose a scalable formulation that combines sustainability, cloud resilience, and performance as a joint optimization problem with multiple interdependent objectives to address these issues holistically. Given the complexity and dynamicity of the problem, machine learning (ML) approaches, such as reinforcement learning, are essential for achieving continuous optimization. Our study highlights the challenges of green energy instability which necessitates innovative ML-centric solutions across heterogeneous infrastructures to manage the transition towards green computing. Underlying the ML-centric solutions must be methods to combine classic system resilience techniques with innovations in real-time ML resilience (not addressed heretofore).

Traffic congestion, pollutant emissions, energy consumption are some of the problems related to urban mobility. Therefore, there is the need of tools able to support decision-makers in studying, evaluating, and planning sustainable urban evolutions. A few open-source and proprietary solutions are available requiring on-premises installations, large effort, and providing limited capabilities to actually handle real-time data (from data spaces, and standards). Moreover, they are limited in terms of analytic integration and do not offer automatic generation of suggestions. In practice they do not manage the explosion of complexity regarding computational and storage/models aspects. For these reasons, this paper presents a comprehensive architecture for a Smart City Digital Twin platform, specifically designed to support mobility and transportation decision-making through advanced what-if analysis and optimization. The platform, integrated within the Snap4City system, enables real-time data processing and complex analytics to create virtual urban environments for evaluating potential infrastructure changes. Through microservice architecture, the platform supports massive data ingestion, scenario creation, and predictive modelling, facilitating both short-term and long-term planning. The solution leverages artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize city operations and suggest actionable insights, aiding city planners in strategic and tactical decisions. This architecture has been validated through implementations in Italian cities, demonstrating scalability and flexibility to accommodate diverse urban needs and improve traffic flow, energy efficiency, and environmental impact.

The homogeneous, predictable, and efficient infrastructure has made Cloud an adequate solution for the processing and analysis of data from IoT objects. However, the benefits of using cloud proved to be problematic for latency sensitive IoT systems that require geographic distribution, consideration of the local environment, and mobility of objects. Fog computing is an emergent concept aimed at extending cloud at the edge of the IoT. Thus, it envisions a layer of nodes (Fogs), making it possible to provide connected objects with support for communication management and data persistence. This paper is motivated by the promising opportunities for the concept of fog computing. We propose a fog computing Framework based on SSN ontology for IoT applications, by applying it to an intelligent parking system that, on the one hand, exploits IoT objects with services and, on the other hand, increases the representation and data consumption with local analyzes at the Fog nodes. For demonstrating, the effectiveness of our implemented framework, simulations have been performed in SUMO, a simulation tool used for urban traffic. Simulation results exhibit that the proposed fog-based implementation reduces the parameters of latency and network usage when contrasted with cloud-based deployment of the smart car parking system.","","979-8-3315-4017-3","10.1109/ISSATK62463.2024.10808950","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10808950","Internet of Things (IoT);Cloud Computing;Fog Computing;smart parking","Hands;Heart;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Simulation;Computer architecture;Automated parking;Ontologies;Internet of Things;Edge computing","","","","13","IEEE","25 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"High Performance Cloud Ready Parallel Batch Processing using Auto Scaling Containers and Queue Technique","A.

Existing Batch system are running in dedicated servers and at most one Job can be processed at a time. Which results in higher costs. Also, batch jobs run in sequential to avoid duplicate processing of data so it will take more time. Where as in our proposed system we use queue to avoid duplicate and containers to achieve parallel processing and once job completed containers will be decommissioned and no need to pay for cloud provider when not in use. Hence, this proposed system is using queue mechanisms like RabbitMQ and Multiple containers(pods) all the containers can run parallelly and get inputs from queue so that duplicate processing will not happen in parallel processing to complete the job faster. This is achieved by Auto scaling mechanism, and the paper proposes a novel algorithm called Chunk Optimized Processing based on Queue Length (COPQL). Particularly, one of the main parts of this system is the Initiator, whose job it is to read data from source and push messages(data) into the queue as chunks, especially the primary keys from the database. RabbitMQ queues has been utilized by the proposed system, which are configured with specific topics or queues for each job type and set up as a 3-node cluster to ensure fault tolerance. Multiple processors (containerized nodes) have been included in the system for each job type, which can automatically scale based on the new Chunk Optimized Processing based on Queue Length (COPQL) algorithm. Each processor reads a chunk, consisting of a group of primary keys, retrieves the corresponding data from the source database, performs the necessary business processing, and updates the status in the Batch DB upon completion. It is highly notable that other features include a retry mechanism for handling failures in specific chunks, a caching mechanism to improve processing speed, and a tracking mechanism to monitor the batch process and to generate final reports. Importantly, the COPQL algorithm has been designed to achieve Low cost (serverless model) and minimal processing time for batch. Particularly, the system has been implemented by using Python, and the results have been analyzed based on weighted sum completion time and the effect of the number of tasks per user.","","979-8-3315-4036-4","10.1109/ICSES63445.2024.10763354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10763354","Batch job;parallel processing;multiple processors;cloud server;RabbitMQ","Program processors;Costs;Processor scheduling;Databases;Heuristic algorithms;Batch production systems;Containers;Parallel processing;Monitoring;Sorting","","","","20","IEEE","3 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The automated tools such as Artificial Intelligence based platforms ChatGPT, Otter etc are proven to be building block for next generation data enabled systems. With the growing number of data-oriented applications, cloud computing is required to enhance the computational capacity and reduce the burden of handling concurrent requests. Cloud is providing all the support in terms of infrastructure demand, but there are challenges in terms of serving the time constraint request. Due to the restricted bandwidth, computational execution time, and resource availability when the applications and data are expanding in unavoidable situations. As the cloud is far from IoT devices to serve time-sensitive requests, multi hop communication is required to deploy to overcome this issue. Much research is done in Fog and Edge computing, but still it is required to resolve the problem of higher latency when pushing the compute intensive task to cloud layers. Edge computing brings the relevant resources near to the edge of the network. In this paper, the edge computing architecture has been designed to perform the multi hop communication and compared the result between the Cloud, Fog and Edge layers. The architecture is simulated using the iFogSim2 simulator and benchmark configurations are used. The results indicate that the latency and the usage of the network at the Edge layer is reduced compared to Fog and Cloud, which concludes that the designed architecture is suitable for the time constraint applications.","","979-8-3503-1487-8","10.1109/ETNCC59188.2023.10284929","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10284929","Cloud Computing;Fog/Edge Computing;IFogSim simulator;Time constraint applications","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Spread spectrum communication;Computational efficiency;Time factors;Internet of Things","","","","24","IEEE","24 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Service composition, the process of integrating multiple services to deliver unified functionality, is crucial in this context. However, traditional service composition techniques fall short in highly dynamic and open environments such as the IoT ecosystem, necessitating decentralized models that can effectively support service composition in such settings. The self-organizing microservice composition model for IoT addresses this need by leveraging decentralized, localized interactions that utilize bio-inspired mechanisms. These mechanisms enable the system to autonomously form complex service compositions with minimal human intervention through emergent behaviour, enhancing the system's flexibility, adaptability, and overall performance. This paper presents a model specifically designed for the IoT ecosystem, focusing on healthcare applications. The model dynamically responds to changing conditions, such as varying patient needs, device availability, and network conditions, making it highly suitable for critical healthcare environments.

Torrellas",University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Microsoft Azure Research - Systems; Microsoft Azure Research - Systems; Microsoft Azure Research - Systems; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,2024 57th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO),"3 Dec 2024","2024","","","1397","1412","With serverless computing, users develop scalable applications using lightweight functions as building blocks, while cloud providers own most of the computing stack, allowing for better resource optimizations. In this paper, we observe that modern server-class processors are inefficiently utilized in serverless environments. Cores perform frequent context switches within function invocations and have a high degree of oversubscription. In such an environment, functions frequently lose their micro-architectural state in stateful hardware structures like caches, TLBs, and branch predictors, causing performance degradation. At the same time, modern processors are dimensioned for the needs of a broad set of applications, rendering them suboptimal for serverless workloads. Based on these insights, we propose Mosaic, an architecture optimized for serverless environments that maintains generality to efficiently support other workloads. Mosaic has two components: (1) MosaicCPU, a processor architecture that efficiently runs both serverless workloads and traditional monolithic applications, and (2) MosaicScheduler, a software stack for serverless systems that maximizes the benefits of MosaicCPU. MosaicCPU slices micro-architectural structures into small chunks and assigns tiles of such chunks to functions. The processor retains the state of functions in their tiles across context switches, thereby improving performance. Furthermore, currently-inactive tiles are set to a low power mode, thereby reducing energy consumption. In addition, MosaicScheduler maximizes efficiency by introducing predictive right-sizing of the per-function tiles, alongside with smart scheduling based on the state of the tiles. Overall, compared to conventional server-class processors, Mosaic improves the throughput of serverless workloads by 225% while using 22% less power.","2379-3155","979-8-3503-5057-9","10.1109/MICRO61859.2024.00103","NSF(grant numbers:CNS 1956007,CCF 2107470,CCF 2316233); Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC); DARPA; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10764517","Cloud computing;Serverless computing;Hardware partitioning","Context;Schedules;Program processors;Processor scheduling;Full stack;Serverless computing;Computer architecture;Throughput;Rendering (computer graphics);Optimization","","","","91","IEEE","3 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fine-grained monitoring of container power is an important content of data center energy efficiency management. However, the power sensors provided by the hardware can only provide the overall power at the server level, which will cause us to obtain power information at a very coarse power granularity.

This system draws inspiration from the architectural principles of edge and fog computing. LSS leverages an innovative architectural paradigm known as Function as a Service (FaaS), which demonstrates an even finer granularity compared to the traditional microservices architecture. Within the framework of LSS, we have discretely compartmentalized distinct operational elements, such as data acquisition and storage, model computation, and model visualization, into Docker microservices. This strategic shift in design effectively alleviates the need for developers to be overly concerned with the intricacies of server management and domain-specific industrial knowledge. Consequently, this enables them to shift their focus towards determining ""what needs to be accomplished,"" thereby transforming the granularity of work from being server-centric to a more task-centric perspective. In comparison to simulation platforms within other frameworks, LSS distinguishes itself through its remarkable attributes, which include a lightweight structure, minimal coupling, and superior real-time performance. These unique qualities substantially enhance the collaborative, shared, and reusable capabilities of simulation systems across various dimensions. To substantiate the viability of LSS, this paper provides empirical evidence by applying it to Electrolysis and partial cascade algorithms in the context of hydrometallurgy. The results underscore the fact that the LSS system significantly improves modeling efficiency, fosters the reusability of models and algorithms, and elevates the level of industrial automation across diverse processes.","2690-5965","979-8-3503-3071-7","10.1109/ICPADS60453.2023.00162","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10475928","Lightweight;System simulation;Industrial automation;Cloud collaboration","Computational modeling;Refining;Microservice architectures;Collaboration;Data models;Servers;Task analysis","","","","19","IEEE","26 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Newer mobile generations, optimizations, modernizations, technology changes, and various mergers have been experienced in the past decades. Different drivers continuously shift physical network elements towards software (SW) only deployments in all IP telecommunication networks. The decoupling of application SW from hardware (HW) is accelerated by virtualization. The ‘cloudification’ of legacy telecommunication equipment made communication networks not only more flexible, but also opened new doors. Brand new services became available thanks to the ongoing fusion of two domains: telecommunications and IT (Information Technology). A new era called ‘Telco-Cloud’ was born. One original goal was to use commercial IT computing servers as HW platform hoping cost efficiency. Another expected benefit was the prompt use of existing experience in the operation and maintenance of IT HW in Data Centers. More and more network functions are virtualized on top of IT HW nowadays. However, the strict requirements of the legacy-Physical Network Function (PNF) based-telecommunications mandate special configurations and practices on cloud. The rapidly increasing amount of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) and Cloud-native Network Functions (CNFs) introduces new concepts for dimensioning, deployment, operation, management, and monitoring. Some availability and operability requirements and expectations are inherited from the legacy PNF domain, meanwhile the telecommunication world itself undergoes a continuous change towards Telco-Cloud and 5G/6G. This paper overviews the evolution steps to Telco-Cloud. The challenges in the dimensioning and availability design are discussed, and some concepts and examples are presented on NF and network levels.","2834-8265","979-8-3503-8845-9","10.1109/CoBCom62281.2024.10631212","Nokia CNS; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10631212","Cloud;PNF;VNF;CNF;TAS;dimensioning;capacity;traffic profile;pooling;availability;redundancy","Cloud computing;Roads;Software;Telecommunications;Software reliability;Telecommunication network reliability;Servers","","","","38","IEEE","19 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address the challenge, a joint online optimization problem for DL model deployment (including placement and update) and freshness-sensitive task assignment is formulated to improve QoE and application service provider (ASP) profit. In the problem, we introduce the age of information (AOI) to quantify the freshness of the DL model and represent user QoE as an AOI based utility function. To solve the problem, an online model placement, update, and task assignment (MPUTA) algorithm is proposed. It first converts the time-slot coupled problem into a single time-slot problem using the regularization technique, and decomposes the single time-slot problem into model deployment and task assignment subproblems. Then, using the randomized round technique to deal with the model deployment subproblem and the graph matching technique to solve the task assignment subproblem.

Examples include the creation of federations of NATO countries and non- NATO entities participating in missions (Federated Mission Networking) or the interaction of civilian services and the military when providing Humanitarian Assistance And Disaster Relief. Federations are often formed on an ad hoc basis, with the primary goal of combining forces in a federated mission environment at any time, on short notice, and with optimization of the resources involved. One of the leading security challenges in a federated environment of separate IoT administrative domains is effective identity and access management, which is the basis for establishing a relationship of trust and secure communication between IoT devices belonging to different partners. When carrying out missions involving the military and ensuring security, meeting requirements for immediate inter operability is important. In the paper, an attempt has been made to develop a system architecture framework for secure and reliable data streams distribution in a multi-organizational federation environment, where data authentication is based on IoT device identity (fingerprint). Moreover, a hardware-software IoT gateway has been proposed for the verification process and the integration of Hyperledger Fabric's distributed ledger technology, the Apache Kafka message broker, and data-processing microservices implemented using the Kafka Streams API library. The performance tests conducted confirm the suitability of the developed system framework for processing and distributing audiovideo data in a federation IoT environment.

However, JIT compilation is achieved at the cost of additional CPU cycles and memory. In the context of modern cloud, where applications have limited computing resources due to containerization, JIT compilation may potentially become a pain-point. The Semeru Cloud Compiler (SCC) is a promising solution that offloads JIT compilation to a remote cloud compiler to reduce the local overhead of JIT compilation in containers. In this paper, we outline novel research directions to further leverage the advantages of remote cloud compilation by extending the SCC to achieve two goals: (i) reduce application start-up time and (ii) improve JIT compilation decision making. To reduce application start-up time, the proposed enhancement is to extract unused or unlikely to be used Java class files from container images. The SCC can still provide the extracted class files to the client JVM if any turn out to be needed. Our preliminary experiments show that this approach can potentially reduce container image sizes by up to 22.1% and start-up times by up to 9.2% for certain applications. To reduce JIT compilation overhead, the proposed enhancement is to perform dynamic analysis of the Java application using the additional resources on the server-side. In turn, the remote JIT compilation can make more informed decisions regarding which methods to compile and optimizations to apply. We are also developing a novel visualization tool designed to help JIT compiler developers identify pain points in current JIT compilation heuristics. Specifically, we have measured that up to 18.9% of JIT compilations for certain applications may be sub-optimal due to later method inlining, and we are investigating how the SCC could help to avoid these potentially wasted compile-time computations by using information learned from other JVM clients.","","979-8-3315-0483-0","10.1109/CASCON62161.2024.10838216","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10838216","cloud computing;remote compilation;JIT compilation;container run-time optimization","Java;Visualization;Pain;Decision making;Containers;Throughput;Dynamic scheduling;Virtual machining;Software;Optimization","","","","45","IEEE","17 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One solution to improve mobility is to promote environmentally friendly modes of transportation, such as bicycles. Bike-Sharing Systems provide a more accessible way to make this mode of transportation available, with the most recent dockless system allowing users to unlock and use a bike with a smartphone app, and then lock it at their destination. However, the system's high demand for data transmission can create bottlenecks when using only the cloud. Using fog computing can solve this problem by bringing resources closer to the edge and reducing response time. This paper analyzes the performance of fog computing in the Bike-Sharing System and compares it to cloud computing, using IFogSim 2.

With highly intelligent equipment deployed on fully-automated production lines, even a slight anomaly may seriously impact the entire manufacturing process. However, most industrial data containing slight anomalous features exhibits strong correlations that are not fully exploited by existing machine learning models. In general, the anomaly detection model needs to run within programmable logic controllers (PLCs) since it is the main controller of the intelligent equipment, and PLCs have limited resources making it difficult to execute larger models effectively. To address the challenge, we propose a graph anomaly detection method in programmable logic controllers based on service computing (PCSC). The model establishes a data relationship graph through clustering and then feeds it into a neural network with a symmetric structure consisting of graph convolutional layers and LSTM units. This approach enables the analysis of correlations within industrial data and facilitates the extraction of slight abnormal features. For efficient execution of the model, we establish service computing nodes in the PLCs that support model splitting. We tested the model on several publicly available datasets and an actual dataset from an injection molding production line. The results show that the model performs well on different datasets.","2836-3868","979-8-3503-6855-0","10.1109/ICWS62655.2024.00142","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10707450","anomaly detection;programmable logic controller;service computing;graph neural networks","Adaptation models;Correlation;Computational modeling;Programmable logic devices;Service computing;Computer architecture;Feature extraction;Data models;Anomaly detection;Long short term memory","","","","36","IEEE","15 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The channel state knowledge is obsolete and is an inherent obstacle and if the Channel State Information (CSI) is extended then only the sub-optimally C-RAN operations could be carried out. In a stochastic optimization system, this can be formulated as the issue of the topology designs. This system maximizes the amount of MCC resources with limitations to the response latency for each MCC customer.

The increasing adoption of microservice architectures, while offering scalability and flexibility, poses new challenges in the effective management of systems’ energy consumption.This study analyzes experimentally the effectiveness, with respect to energy consumption, of algorithms for Anomaly Detection (AD) and Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for (containerized) microservices systems. The study analyzes five AD and three RCA algorithms. Metrics to assess the effectiveness of AD algorithms are Precision, Recall, and F-Score. For RCA algorithms, the chose metric is Precision at level k. Two subjects of different complexity are used: Sock Shop and UNI-Cloud. Experiments use a cross-over paired comparison design, involving multiple randomized runs for robust measures.The experiments show that AD algorithms exhibit a relatively moderate performance. The mean adjusted Precision for Sock Shop is 61.5%, while it is 75% for the best-performing algorithms (BIRCH, KNN, and SVM) on UNI-Cloud. The Recall and F-Score for UNI-Cloud, for the same algorithms, are 75%, while for Sock Shop KNN yields the best outcome at roughly 45%. MicroRCA and RCD emerge as the top-performing algorithms for RCA.We found that the effectiveness of AD algorithms is strongly influenced by anomaly thresholds, emphasizing the importance of careful tuning such algorithms. RCA algorithms reveal promising results, particularly RCD and MicroRCA, which showed robust performance. However, challenges remain, as seen with the ϵ-diagnosis algorithm, suggesting the need for further refinement.For DevOps engineers, the findings highlight the need to carefully select and tune AD and RCA algorithms for energy, and to take into account system topology and monitoring configurations.","2836-3868","979-8-3503-6855-0","10.1109/ICWS62655.2024.00079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10707452","Microservices;Energy consumption;Anomaly Detection;Root Cause Analysis","Measurement;Energy consumption;Root cause analysis;Web services;Software algorithms;Microservice architectures;Nearest neighbor methods;Topology;Anomaly detection;Tuning","","","","39","IEEE","15 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

All EDs send feedback about their states and actions to the BTS which reaches it after a fixed deterministic delay. We analyze this team problem with delayed feedback as a cooperative Multi-Agent Constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (MA-C-POMDP).First, using a recently established strong duality result for MAC-POMDPs, the original problem is decomposed into N independent unconstrained transmitter-receiver (two-agent) problems— all sharing a Lagrange multiplier (that also needs to be optimized for optimal control). Thereafter, the common information (CI) approach and the formalism of approximate information states (AISs) are used to guide the design of a neural-network based architecture for learning-based multi-agent control in a single unconstrained transmitter-receiver problem.

To overcome this, this work investigates how softwarization with redundancy can achieve resilience improvements in such networks. We present an architecture and prototypical implementation of a fiber-based access network and subscriber termination, with a redundant and adaptive design throughout the whole path from subscribers to the Internet. By proactively migrating states and steering subscriber flows, we reached total average downtimes of around 156 milliseconds to restore Internet access after disruption in the case of one subscriber. In comparison, it takes hours to restore Internet access in case of an outage with zero redundancy. Our solution is cost-effective by exploiting the architectural advances of Software Defined Networking, allowing the use of virtualized network functions and hardware-based functions simultaneously.","2832-2231","979-8-3503-8053-8","10.1109/NFV-SDN61811.2024.10807483","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10807483","PON;Resilience;NFV;SDN;Subscriber Steering;Hardware Acceleration;Access Networks;Redundancy","Network topology;Redundancy;Computer architecture;Optical fiber networks;Hardware;Internet;Topology;Network function virtualization;Software defined networking;Resilience","","","","17","IEEE","27 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, the operation index is extracted on a daily basis to form a collection sample, which is used as a cloud droplet of the cloud model, and the fuzzy representation of the operation index is formed by using the reverse cloud generator. Finally, the fuzzy distance between the operation index and the label template is weighted to sum, and the scoring value of the operation index is obtained.

New industrial applications, the Internet of Things (IoT), and technologies like augmented, virtual, and mixed reality (AR/VR/MR) require networks that can handle event-based operations and middleware with very low and predictable latency. These requirements pose performance optimization challenges for packet processing in a layered infrastructure. In this study, we look deep into the challenges of implementing such network infrastructures using general-purpose hardware, a strategy motivated by its flexibility to realize telco-cloud and the potential to reduce electronic waste. Focusing on NFV with an emphasis on containerized network functions (CNFs), we investigate the performance limitations, particularly the high jitter and throughput variation observed in packet forwarding. We used a network function (NF) implemented using defacto industry standard user-space I/O architecture DPDK in bare-metal and containerized environments for performance evaluation. We conducted ten experiments in a 40 GbE environment to measure throughput, latency, and jitter across various packet sizes, traffic rates, and system configurations. The results indicate that adjusting CPU settings can significantly enhance throughput for CNFs despite a potential increase in jitter. We found that CNFs are feasible for latency-sensitive tasks, particularly under conditions of low traffic and specific packet sizes. With careful system-level configuration, CNFs can be used in beyond 5G cloud-native networking, offering promising potential for latency-sensitive applications.","2836-3795","979-8-3503-7696-8","10.1109/COMPSAC61105.2024.00251","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10633329","6G;Network Function Virtualization (NFV);Containerized Network Functions (CNFs);COTS;Cloud Native;Jitter;Latency;DPDK","Industries;Cloud computing;5G mobile communication;Jitter;Throughput;Hardware;Network function virtualization","","","","23","IEEE","26 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Function unavailability occurs due to various reasons, and when such failures are detected, the nodes hosting the backup resources can attempt autonomously local recovery, leveraging precomputed recovery policies, without the need for central processor intervention, thereby reducing recovery time. In scenarios involving shared protection with limited recovery capabilities, it is crucial to implement a well-defined policy for local recovery. Such a policy prevents repetitive or infeasible recovery attempts, ensuring effective recovery. This paper considers a local strategy to maximize the residual resilience, where individual nodes decide which function to recover. It hence works as a complement to global recovery to provide prompt recovery, as a first line of defense. This paper hence considers the preparation of priority settings with preprocessing based on the SUPPORTED model. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the conditions for achieving feasible and optimal local recovery solutions with zero-round communication for one and two failures. Additionally, we formulate the problem as an integer linear programming problem and design a testbed to implement the local recovery algorithm incorporating preprocessing. Our evaluation reveals that the zero-round communication approach emerges as the optimal choice, drastically shortening recovery times to 10−6 seconds while maintaining $\mathbf{9 8 \%}$ feasibility and perfect optimality for all practical solutions, on average, across two failure scenarios.","2576-3539","979-8-3315-1818-9","10.1109/RNDM64105.2024.10820396","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820396","Local recovery;preprocessing;distributed algorithm;shared protection;fault tolerance;residual resilience;network virtualization","Fault tolerance;Conferences;Fault tolerant systems;Microservice architectures;Integer linear programming;User experience;Protection;Virtualization;Low latency communication;Resilience","","","","19","IEEE","7 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing research mainly considers optimizing resource allocation and task processing delays, ignoring the impact of transmission delays in fluctuating network environments. However, the transmission time of tasks or requests may be longer than the processing time, which can significantly affect the quality of service for delay-sensitive services. In such scenarios, the static strategies of EdgeMesh always perform terribly under unstable network. This makes the transmission time of task data fluctuate frequently, resulting in an increase in response time. Therefore, we proposed an adaptive strategy based on network-aware to improve the transmission delay. We implemented such a strategy by developing a proxy named NAP to assist EdgeMesh in dynamic traffic management. In order to adapt to the complex and volatile conditions of edge networks, NAP monitors every node in real-time. It determines the feasible path with the shortest expected transmission time based on the size of different task data, network and resources status among nodes, then proxies the traffic and forwards it in the kernel state. Numerous experimental results demonstrate that NAP can reduce task transmission time by $50 \%$ and significantly improve the end-to-end request latency in edge computing environments compared to native strategies of EdgeMesh.","2690-5965","979-8-3315-1596-6","10.1109/ICPADS63350.2024.00055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10763657","Traffic management;Real-Time;Edge computing;KubeEdge;EdgeMesh","Wireless communication;Performance evaluation;Adaptive systems;Source coding;Quality of service;Real-time systems;Delays;Time factors;Resource management;Edge computing","","","","28","IEEE","28 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cloud computing represents a small fraction of global energy consumption, but trends indicate it will continue to grow, driven by Big Data and AI. AI analytics are pushing computing resources, especially CPUs and GPUs, to their limits. However, powerful CPUs and GPUs, consume tons of energy and require cooling appliances, which results into higher operating cost and as an indirect consequence, higher pollution and global warming. Based on these issues, we present a survey on measuring and reducing energy, especially when processing analytic workloads. We discuss tradeoffs between high performance (low latency to get results) and low energy (less power consumed over time). Our focus is on identifying modern hardware components which have a significant impact on energy consumption and then examining how software optimizations can manage hardware to reduce energy in a cloud data center. We conclude with a tentative research agenda, based on the state of the art of research at the intersection of big data analytics, high performance computing, electrical energy and cloud computing.","2573-2978","979-8-3503-6248-0","10.1109/BigData62323.2024.10825559","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10825559","","Surveys;Cloud computing;Energy consumption;Pollution;Production;Big Data;Hardware;Software;Pollution measurement;Artificial intelligence","","","","33","IEEE","16 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These applications are often prone to failures, since they have many independent services deployed on heterogeneous environments. When employed “correctly”, observability can help developers identify and troubleshoot faults quickly. However, instrumenting and configuring the observability of a microservice application is not trivial but tool-dependent and tied to costs. Practitioners need to understand observability-related tradeoffs in order to weigh between different observability design alternatives. Still, these architectural design decisions are not supported by systematic methods and typically just rely on”professional intuition”. To assess observability design tradeoffs with concrete evidence, we advocate for conducting experiments that compare var-ious design alternatives. Achieving a systematic and repeatable experiment process necessitates automation. We present a proof-of-concept implementation of an experiment tool - Observability eXperiment eNgine (OXN). Oxn is able to inject arbitrary faults into an application, similar to Chaos Engineering, but also possesses the unique capability to modify the observability configuration, allowing for the straightforward assessment of design decisions that were previously left unexplored.","2768-4288","979-8-3503-6625-9","10.1109/ICSA-C63560.2024.00035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10628419","Observability;Microservices;Software Architecture","Fault diagnosis;Systematics;Costs;Software architecture;Instruments;Microservice architectures;Training data","","","","16","IEEE","21 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Developing effective rules or AI algorithms requires a deep understanding of this data to reliably detect unfore-seen anomalies. This paper seeks to comprehend anomalies and current anomaly detection approaches across diverse industrial sectors. Additionally, it aims to pinpoint the parameters necessary for identifying anomalies via runtime monitoring data. Therefore, we conducted semi-structured interviews with fifteen industry participants who rely on anomaly detection during runtime. Additionally, to supplement information from the interviews, we performed a literature review focusing on anomaly detection approaches applied to industrial real-life datasets. Our paper (1) demonstrates the diversity of interpretations and examples of software anomalies during runtime and (2) explores the reasons behind choosing rule-based approaches in the industry over self-developed AI approaches. AI-based approaches have become prominent in published industry-related papers in the last three years.

Sharp enables and facilitates a comprehensive characterization of the performance distribution of an application, while orchestrating experiments efficiently. Sharp addresses these key challenges using (a) robust performance analysis and comparison with Similarity Metrics; (b) the automatic determination of a reliable sample size through a diverse set of Stopping Rules; and (c) comprehensive recording of experimental conditions and results.We showcase the need for and advantages of Sharp by evaluating the performance of 20 Rodinia benchmarks on 3 HPC servers with different CPU and GPU configurations. We empirically evaluate Sharp to expose the need for distribution-based statistics, and demonstrate how the stopping rules of Sharp attain reliable performance results while minimizing resource usage up to ∼90% relative to a large fixed number of experiments sufficient enough to establish ground-truth.

To solve this problem, there are two main solutions: eXpress Data Path (XDP) and Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK). XDP and the AF _XDP socket offer full interoperability with the legacy system and is being adopted by major internet players like Open vSwitch or Facebook. While the performance evaluation of AF _XDP against the legacy protocol stack in the kernel or against DPDK has been studied in the literature, the impact of the multiple socket parameters and the system configuration on its latency has been left aside. To address this, we conduct an experimental study to understand the XDP/AF _XDP ecosystem and detect microseconds delays to better architect future latency-sensitive applications. Since the performance of AF _XDP depends on multiple parameters found in different layers, finding the configuration minimizing its latency is a challenging task. We rely on a classification algorithm to group the performance results, allowing us to easily identify parameters with the biggest impact on performance at different loads. Last, but not least, we show that some configurations can significantly decrease the benefits of AF _XDP, leading to undesirable behaviors, while other configurations are able to reduce such round trip delays to an impressive value of 6.5 μS in the best case, including the tracing overhead. In summary, AF _XDP is a promising solution, and careful selection of both application and socket parameters can significantly improve performance.","1938-1883","978-1-7281-9054-9","10.1109/ICC51166.2024.10622351","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10622351","Latency;XDP;AF _XDP;High Performance;Linux;Network Drivers","Social networking (online);Sockets;Quality of service;Delays;Servers;Kernel;Task analysis","","","","27","IEEE","20 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Exposure to such threats grows when IaaS is deployed on distributed computing nodes at the edge. This work identifies a potential vulnerability of low-power CPUs that facilitates stealing the deep neural network architecture without physical access to the hardware or interference with the execution flow.

Population-based methods including swarm intelligence and evolutionary computation algorithms have many advantages that make them prominent meta-heuristic solutions into many combinatorial problems.

Since they are the primary target of Cloud applications, it would be beneficial to actively involve them in reducing the carbon footprint of Cloud applications. In this paper, we offer end-users a way to influence the carbon footprint of Cloud applications they use. To this end, we ask end-users to select a high-level mode to control the carbon footprint of a Cloud application. We then design a dynamic adaptation algorithm that determines an appropriate configuration for the application for each request, based on the end-user mode and on the carbon intensity of the infrastructure energy sources. We implement and evaluate our system on a simple image-resizing application. We run experiments on SeDuCe, a Cloud infrastructure testbed partially powered by solar panels. Our results show that we save energy consumption by up to $84 \%$ when all end-users agree to degrade the quality of the application’s output, and we provide a good quality-energy trade-off when end-users make heterogeneous choices.

We propose a distributed scheduler using multidimensional spaces and data structures aimed at comprehensive load balancing, energy efficiency, and QoS. The scheduler indexes devices within the structure based on diverse criteria such as hardware availability, GPS, and energy features. It then organizes applications into abstract graphs, where nodes are containers and their data items (units of data accessed by the containers), and edges are the transfer rates among them. To migrate containers, the scheduler performs range queries within the structure for optimal devices. To organize data items, it finds the barycenter of the devices executing the containers linked to them. We evaluated our scheduler’s effectiveness using the PISCO simulator, comparing it against other energy-efficient schedulers.","2996-1483","979-8-3503-6919-9","10.1109/ISPDC62236.2024.10705392","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10705392","distributed systems;power;energy;scheduling","Performance evaluation;Location awareness;Processor scheduling;Quality of service;Containers;Load management;Energy efficiency;Scheduling;Hardware;Optimization","","","","28","IEEE","28 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Being potentially applied to any kind of physical asset, the Digital Twin approach can create a synergy for a comprehensive modeling, monitoring, and forecasting of the same asset. In the energy domain, Digital Twins can facilitate the decision making by providing interactive dashboards to the stakeholders within a metaverse instance.

From the SLR results, we developed an architecture for IoT-based IPS applications, using Fog Computing elements, to support AAL systems. We evaluate the architecture using the iFogSim simulation environment regarding latency, network usage, and energy consumption. The proposed approach was compared to a cloud-based deployment. Experimental results show that the proposed fog-based architecture significantly reduces latency, network usage, and operational costs and is suitable for real-time response scenarios. In addition, the energy consumption of cloud data centers is reduced by employing fog computing.","","979-8-3503-9749-9","10.1109/ICSA56044.2023.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10092619","ambient assisted living;fog computing;indoor positioning system;internet of things;software architecture","Energy consumption;Cloud computing;Ambient assisted living;Systematics;Software architecture;Computer architecture;Software","","","","57","IEEE","24 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Continuum systems are dynamic, often massive in scale, and feature disparate infrastructure providers and platforms; this greatly increase the complexity of developing and managing applications. The Serverless paradigm shows the potential to greatly simplify the process of building Continuum applications - however, current scheduling mechanisms for Serverless Continuum platforms pay little attention to reducing the energy consumption and improving the sustainability of function execution. This is a significant omission, made worse as computing nodes within a Continuum may be powered by renewable energy sources that are intermittent and unpredictable, making low-powered and bottleneck nodes unavailable.There is great opportunity to design a decentralized energy management scheme for scheduling Serverless functions that takes advantage of the different layers of the Continuum, such as IoT devices located at the Edge, on-premises clusters closer to the data sources, or directly on large Cloud infrastructures. To achieve this, we formally model a green energy-aware Serverless workload scheduling problem for the multi-provider Cloud-Edge Continuum. We then design stable matching based technique for decentralized energy management (utilising a distributed controller) that considers the availability of green energy nodes and the QoS requirements of Serverless functions. We prove the complexity, stability and termination of the proposed heuristic algorithm, and also compare its performance with baseline scheduling techniques.","2642-6587","979-8-3315-3958-0","10.1109/SOSE62363.2024.00010","Kempestiftelserna; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10685327","Cloud-Edge Continuum;Serverless Computing;Renewable energy;Scheduling;Function-as-a-Service;Matching","Processor scheduling;Service-oriented systems engineering;Soft sensors;Green products;Serverless computing;Quality of service;Stability analysis","","","","41","IEEE","26 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to high latency and network bottlenecks, Cloud Computing has become rather problematic for real-time applications. Accordingly, Fog Computing has been presented as the missing piece to provide along with cloud Computing for virtually all applications. Application virtualization through containers has become more and more popular in the context of Fog Computing as it simplifies live migration and, in particular, offloading of time-critical applications or their selected tasks. However, the measurement study of the overall offloading latency in Fog Computing has not been sufficiently investigated. This article proposes a measurement analysis of the offloading latency of time-critical application tasks from the end device, such as a vehicle, to surrounding Fog nodes based on Docker containers, Kubernetes, and checkpointing. Based on our layered offloading framework, several offloading scenarios have been studied. The experimental results show that by preparing the Fog nodes in advance through careful, easy arrangements, considerable time can be saved when offloading the application to the Fog node within the Fog cluster. We further consider Vehicular Fog Computing (VFC) as a popular example of time-critical Fog computing and assess the suitability of various offloading strategies for VFC use cases.","","979-8-3503-6648-8","10.1109/FMEC62297.2024.10710234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10710234","Fog Computing;Vehicular Fog Computing;Task Offloading;Checkpoints;Application Virtualization;Latency-Critical Applications","Cloud computing;Multi-access edge computing;Atmospheric measurements;Prefetching;Containers;Particle measurements;Real-time systems;Time factors;Internet of Things;Edge computing","","","","22","IEEE","14 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The integration of contain- ers in IoT, facilitates streamlined deployment, scalability, and management of diverse applications, enhancing the efficiency and flexibility of Internet of Things ecosystems. In the realm of container scheduling, the Multi-Objective Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization (MOAPSO) algorithm emerges as a more effective solution compared to the standard Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, particularly when tasked with scheduling a substantial number of containers. Its scalability proves to be a standout feature, positioning MOAPSO as a versatile tool capable of efficiently scheduling in Internet of Things (IoT) applications within expansive cloud environments. The traditional PSO algorithm, while a benchmark, achieves an accuracy rate of 80%, but the introduction of the Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm elevates this metric to an impressive 90.7%. This underscores the enhanced performance and accuracy achievable through the accelerated variant, show- casing its potential to significantly impact container scheduling, particularly in the context of large-scale cloud deployments and IoT applications.

The method fully considers the multi-objective optimisation requirements such as task execution efficiency, delay, resource utilisation and energy consumption, and designs an adaptive scheduling strategy by constructing a dynamic model of tasks and resources. The strategy combines genetic algorithms and deep reinforcement learning techniques to achieve reasonable distribution and collaborative processing of tasks between cloud centres and edge nodes. On the basis of the service configuration mechanism, a processing model for microservices is established. By analysing the constraints in task scheduling, priority constraints, capacity constraints and execution time constraints are pointed out. And the scheduling scheme is selected for the task by a multi-criteria decision-making method based on fuzzy logic.

Resource scheduling and allocation for various aggregate web services is a crucial and challenging problem in cloud computing. This research looks at resource allocation using scalable computing. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), or the service of renting out computer resources through the Internet, is offered to users by cloud computing. The client can select from a variety of computing resources depending on their needs. This approach uses the IaaS model to allocate resources for real-time tasks. Real-Time jobs must be finished ahead of schedules. Elasticity or scalable computing refers to the ability to scale up the resource in this situation in accordance with the demands. The resources are scalable and open to a vast user base. In order to finish real-time work ahead of schedules, the user can choose any number of Virtual Machines (VMs) based on speed and rate. The client leases the virtual machines. Hence the fee is set just for the duration of the rental. Additionally, a method is devised to assign VMs to programs with real-time tasks.

However, platooning introduces significant computational challenges, such as real-time data handling, vehicle communication, and adapting to dynamic environments. These challenges necessitate advanced computational methods for effective task management. Machine Learning (ML) techniques are employed to determine the most suitable server for offloading tasks.

With dynamically changing network topologies, user mobility, multiple access networks, demand-driven service orchestration, and consequently several distributed service instances that are available, methods for selecting edge resources must adapt to these conditions. This consideration is particularly relevant for edge computing, where target applications often have strict Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. This work proposes an edge resource selection scheme that considers several QoS parameters, computing load, and service usage cost. These metrics are employed to derive a selection score through four distinct algorithms. The overall performance of each algorithm is evaluated by scoring examples, a sensitivity analysis, and in a system-level simulation of a fifth generation (5G) cellular network with user mobility and multiple Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) platforms. The results show that all approaches perform well under unambiguous QoS and load conditions, i.e., very good or very poor, but some lose accuracy under moderate, but still acceptable, conditions. For the goal of cost-optimized selection while meeting QoS constraints, one novel method presented is significantly superior to the others. Used in simulation, it generates 12% more computing load on cheaper platforms than its closest competitor, and maintains significantly lower loads on high-cost platforms.","2637-9430","979-8-3503-8461-1","10.1109/ICCCN61486.2024.10637567","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10637567","dge;cloud;MEC;resources;selection;scoring;QoS;latency;performance;load;cost;5G;simulation","Measurement;Cellular networks;Cloud computing;Multi-access edge computing;Costs;Accuracy;Sensitivity analysis","","","","18","IEEE","22 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

LLMs have the ability to produce content that is both coherent and contextually relevant. Notwithstanding, there exist notable obstacles in effectively implementing and overseeing these models within operational settings, especially in infrastructures that are cloud native. A cloud-native system for optimizing and delivering live learning modules on Kubernetes clusters is presented in this study. There are many obstacles in the way of effectively deploying inference services on the cloud. After obtaining a trained model, cloud operators need to specify hardware configurations for every model-serving container. These settings cover a wide range of topics, including CPU core counts, GPU specs, GPU RAM, possible setups for GPU sharing, and runtime parameters like batch size. When combined, these factors provide a vast and intricate configuration space. By utilizing the declarative resource management that Kubernetes provides, the suggested approach leverages declarative resource management capabilities of Kubernetes and allows users to easily train and serve LLMs on those clusters. Kubernetes clusters from a variety of cloud providers, including KIND (provisioned on bare metal), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), are specifically supported by the framework. This Kubernetes custom resource enables users to maximize the performance and cost-effectiveness of LLM deployments by utilizing Kubernetes’ scalability, flexibility, and resource allocation properties and allows to maintain the stable state with use of operators and watch pattern.","","979-8-3503-7519-0","10.1109/ICAAIC60222.2024.10575306","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10575306","Kubernetes;Orchestration;API;Operator","Runtime;Scalability;Graphics processing units;Random access memory;Metals;Machine learning;Natural language processing","","","","15","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As traffic congestion is a major problem in the majority of cities around the world, keeping smart traffic flow on the roads is essential as it helps both citizens and security agencies. The traffic signals continuously turn green or red, and the signals for traffic need to change based on how many vehicles are present in the area. The green lights should be on longer in situations where there is a lot of traffic going in one way, and the red lights should stay on longer in situations where there is less traffic. The first should be given to emergency vehicles like ambulances and fire extinguishing engines. Consequently, the idea suggested here is a system in which the length of the green and red light timings is controlled by the volume of traffic at that particular time. If an emergency vehicle is in a lane, that lane is cleared before any other. The implementation of IoT technology is key to our solution. It allows for wireless connectivity between devices that can be monitored and controlled from anywhere, at any time. We use this technology to connect IR sensors that measure the density of vehicles on the road. Additionally, a camera takes pictures of emergency vehicles which are processed in the server by using image processing techniques where the image is processed and calibrated so that signal is sent to the server. The information about emergency vehicles and the density of traffic on each road is then sent to a microcontroller, specifically the ESP32. The microcontroller uses this information to determine the optimal time for green lights, thereby reducing traffic and pollution.","","979-8-3315-4068-5","10.1109/IConSCEPT61884.2024.10627923","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10627923","IoT technology;vehicle density;infrared sensors;ESP32 cam module","Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Microcontrollers;Roads;Urban areas;Signal processing;Timing","","","","12","IEEE","22 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a method to represent the hierarchical layers and structures found in the current Edge-Cloud Computing Continuum and attempt to solve the scheduling problem of microservices on a Kubernetes-based platform. We present a novel and practical dynamic resource scheduling approach for microservices that extends the scheduling method implemented originally in Kubernetes toward geographical locations and hierarchy of resources. We evaluate the proposed optimized microservice scheduler on our prototype environment that virtualizes the underlying network topologies for heterogeneous resources. The evaluation result shows that our technique successfully decreases the end-to-end response time of tested microservice application with a three-tier architecture.","2473-4683","979-8-3503-8414-7","10.1109/COOLCHIPS61292.2024.10531183","New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10531183","Edge-Cloud Continuum;Cloud Computing;Scheduling;Kubernetes","Cloud computing;Processor scheduling;Scheduling algorithms;Emulation;Microservice architectures;Prototypes;Dynamic scheduling","","","","16","IEEE","17 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional load management methods have high requirements for data accuracy and real-time performance, as well as difficulties in dealing with diverse load characteristics. Therefore, it is particularly urgent to seek a method that can more effectively identify and manage load characteristics. This article proposes a load management method based on clustering technology to address the problems of traditional methods. This method includes steps such as data preprocessing, feature selection, clustering analysis, and interpretation of clustering results. By effectively classifying and managing load data, it is possible to achieve better utilization of energy and improvement of system efficiency. The purpose of this study is to explore a load management method suitable for the Internet of Things environment. Through the application of clustering technology, accurate identification and management of load characteristics have been achieved. The proposal of this method provides new ideas for load management in the energy field, and has important theoretical and practical significance. The experimental results have demonstrated that the CNN algorithm has a longer training time (32.75 seconds) for clustering analysis. The training time of the K-mean algorithm is 13 seconds.

At the information and communication level, the standard IEC 61850 is utilized to model the data structure and logic of field communication units, represent measurements collected from PV (Photovoltaics) inverters, and control options for active power curtailment. This concept considers the scalability of DERs and allows for a repeatable, adaptable, and expandable engineering process.As the core element of the proposed concept, two Python modules containing necessary logic and data interfaces are implemented as microservices based on existing open-source Python libraries. In the real-time SIL environment, virtualized Controllable Local Systems (CLS) run as Intelligent Electronic Devices (IED), which contain a simplified IEC 61850 data model structure and interact with the distribution grid management using the IEC 61850 communication protocol. PV generation profiles are constructed using actual field data, representing real-time measurements from PV inverters. Control commands on the PV feed-in power are transmitted to the PV containers by the same IEC 61850 communication connections.

If this could be accomplished, its impact on the society would be enormous as everyone would have access to information and an opportunity to improve their quality of life and income. This chapter from the IEEE Future Networks CTU Working Group endeavors to highlight the need to consider the CTU requirements in 5G and B5G networks in the standardization process and in the development of the use cases and affordable solutions. In its Vision 2030 SDG (Sustainability Development Goals) the United Nations has proclaimed access to internet as basic human right and has said these goals cannot be achieved without affordable access to internet by everyone on this planet[65]. While there are numerous projects and initiatives ongoing around the world, these are fragmented and lack the critical mass and coordination to be able to impact the future standards, product development, and cost of deployment otherwise achievable by economy of scale. Although difficult to pin down, to define a threshold for basic connectivity for all is important. But it would need to be flexible to adapt to changing times. It is the goal of the CTU group to create an open platform where the experts can bring their ideas, solutions, and potentially collaborate to create large global projects and influence the network service providers, manufacturers and their governments. This paper defines the CTU working group's charter, scope, and provides a brief overview of the relevant stakeholders and linkages between them. Then the paper goes into the current status of the CTU landscape and where we want to reach to accomplish the vision of connecting everybody, especially those living in rural and remote areas. We present the various standards and industry fora and how they are interlinked. While technologies are available today, they need to be customized and optimized at the systems level to bring down the cost of the network to be affordable. In addition, the content needs to be relevant and in local languages to be useful, not to mention the need to offer innovative human computer interaction (HCI) solutions (that are not text based) so that people who are not literate or are digitally disadvantaged can easily use the devices and consume services. Another important area is that of flexible spectrum allocation regime at the lower range of the spectrum to increase reach and coverage. Use of renewable energy sources will enable deployment in remote areas where there is lack of power grid, or it is intermittent. Thus, this paper identifies a number of technology gaps to be filled in by 5G and B5G networks, such that access is affordable and content and services are actually consumed by the targeted set of users. Although hitherto unexplored, artificial intelligence (AI) an machine learning (ML) have tremendous role to play for serving the rural and remote communities both to deliver the most needed services and to customize them to the digital capacity of the end users. Technology aside, the need to develop innovative business models is a must to be commercially sustainable in the long-term. A number of such models, especially designed for the rural population, are proposed, such as Village Level Entrepreneur (VLE) Freemium (Free + Premium), revenue sharing among the chain of service providers, subsidized billing by USOF (Universal Service Obligation Funds). Finally, the paper presents a 10-year roadmap starting from the current state to three years, five years, and ten years.","2770-7679","979-8-3503-2458-7","10.1109/FNWF58287.2023.10520445","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10520445","Digital Divide;5G;B5G;CTU;SDG;IEEE Future Networks;Rural and remote connectivity;United Nations;Societal impact of ICT;Network slicing;Spectrum management;content management;HCI;IoT;TV white space;Satellite;Community networks;VLE;InfoInternet;Internet Lite;Business models","Human computer interaction;Wireless communication;Renewable energy sources;Costs;5G mobile communication;Product development;Stakeholders;Resource management;Sustainable development;Standards","","","","65","IEEE","13 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the practice of placing multiple tenants on shared physical hardware raises security and privacy concerns, most notably side-channel attacks. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of fingerprinting containers through CPU frequency reporting sensors in Intel and AMD CPUs. One key enabler of our attack is that the current CPU frequency information can be accessed by user-space attackers. We demonstrate that Docker images exhibit a unique frequency signature, enabling the distinction of different containers with up to 84.5 % accuracy even when multiple containers are running simultaneously in different cores. Additionally, we assess the effectiveness of our attack when performed against several sandboxes deployed in cloud environments, including Google's gVisor, AWS’ Firecracker, and TEE-based platforms like Gramine (utilizing Intel SGX) and AMD SEV. Our empirical results show that these attacks can also be carried out successfully against all of these sandboxes in less than 40 seconds, with an accuracy of over 70 % in all cases.

To investigate these models, explainable AI (XAI) employs methods that elucidate the relationship between input features and output predictions. The operations of XAI extend beyond the execution of a single algorithm, involving a series of activities that include preprocessing data, adjusting XAI to align with model parameters, invoking the model to generate predictions, and summarizing the XAI results. Adversarial attacks are well-known threats that aim to mislead AI models. The assessment complexity, especially for XAI, increases when open-source AI models are subject to adversarial attacks due to various combinations. To automate the numerous entities and tasks involved in XAI - based assessments, we propose a cloud-based service framework that encapsulates computing components as microser-vices and organizes assessment tasks into pipelines. The current XAI tools are not inherently service-oriented. This framework also integrates open XAI tool libraries as part of the pipeline composition. We demonstrate the application of XAI services for assessing five quality attributes of AI models: (1) computational cost, (2) performance, (3) robustness, (4) explanation deviation, and (5) explanation resilience across computer vision and tabular cases. The service framework generates aggregated analysis that showcases the quality attributes for more than a hundred combination scenarios.","","979-8-3503-6851-2","10.1109/SSE62657.2024.00031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10664210","Software Engineering;Artificial Intelligence;Explainable AI;Adversarial Attacks;Cloud Services;Evaluation Frameworks","Measurement;Computational modeling;Perturbation methods;Pipelines;Predictive models;Software;Robustness","","","","66","IEEE","18 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, research on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) networks has emerged, which aims to solve the coverage problem by relying on small cells mounted on UAVs to provide coverage. From the network Quality of Service (QoS) point of view, i.e., the performance offered to users according to certain parameters such as delay, reliability, and throughput provisioning can be identified as one of the weak points. For the problem of maximizing throughput, the main solution is to group several UAVs in the same area. However, as the offered throughput increases, the power consumption will also increase. In this context, this paper proposes a genetic algorithm to solve the problem of jointly maximizing the offered throughput in rural scenarios where users request microservice-based IoT applications while minimizing the energy consumption of the swarm of UAVs. The algorithm is defined and evaluated in realistic scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness on increasing the throughput while decreasing the number of UAVs that are required.","2642-7389","979-8-3503-5423-2","10.1109/ISCC61673.2024.10733667","Ministry of Economy; Austrian Science Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10733667","UAV;Throughput;Energy efficiency;Genetic algorithm;Rural areas;MSA","Smart agriculture;Energy consumption;Microservice architectures;Quality of service;Throughput;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Telecommunications;Telecommunication network reliability;Investment;Genetic algorithms","","","","31","IEEE","31 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So far, VMs schedulers mostly implement all-or-nothing oversubscription strategies, wherein all VM resources are either oversubscribed or remain unaltered. While the former strategy offers higher consolidation rates, the latter delivers better performance guarantees.In this paper, we conducted an empirical study of the individual usage of virtual CPUs (vCPUs) in the OVHCloud production environment and we demonstrate that, as they are not uniformly utilized, the current holistic approach may not be appropriate. Based on these observations, we introduce a novel approach, named SweetspotVM, where oversubscription ratios are applied at the granularity of individual vCPU, instead of the whole VMs. This novel paradigm unlocks a more flexible oversubscription management strategy, pinning oversubscription ratios per vCPU within VMs. We present a prototype of SweetspotVM to illustrate the feasibility of accommodating multiple oversubscription levels within a single host and assigning them to individual vCPU.We assess the viability of our approach on a physical platform, demonstrating the possibility of dividing the cost of hosting VMs by 3, while maintaining the VMs performance at the level of non-oversubscribed platforms. We, therefore, believe that SweetspotVM opens new avenues to boost the consolidation of VMs on a reduced number of servers, with positive impacts on the environmental footprint of cloud computing.","2993-2114","979-8-3503-9566-2","10.1109/CCGrid59990.2024.00026","Agence Nationale de la Recherche; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10701371","Cloud;Oversubscription;IaaS","Industries;Cloud computing;Costs;Customer services;Prototypes;Production;Software;Servers;Resource management;Tuning","","","","29","IEEE","8 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, the PHY-layer processing chain is software-implemented and the various splitting options are tested on low-cost processors, such as Raspberry Pi (RP) 3B+ and 4B.

Recently, a great effort has been made to mitigate this impact, while the demand for computational resources has continued to grow. Current mitigation strategies focus on the infrastructure perspective, while the application perspective has been neglected. This paper aims to engage application designers and developers on the path to greener application design. Following the Sustainable Application Design Process (SADP) methodology, we introduce a Sustainable Application Design Architecture (SADA) for enriching cloud-native application components with sustainability features that can be exploited to adapt the application workflow to the environmental context. The architecture enables synergies from design to deployment between all stakeholders involved in the application management. The paper focuses on enriching the application with sustainability features in the design and development phases. We also present and discuss a prototype that can translate design-level sustainability features into development features.","2694-0825","979-8-3503-4394-6","10.1109/IC2E59103.2023.00011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10305842","cloud-native applications;green IS;application design;adaptive workflow;microservices","Green products;Prototypes;Microservice architectures;Computer architecture;Quality of service;Energy efficiency;Stakeholders","","","","51","IEEE","6 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most researches focused on the performance enhancement for specific mission scenarios, which limits their versatility, increases their burden, and leads to a lot of duplicate investment. To relieve this tension, a task-agnostic dispersed collaborative computing framework (DOCF) for aerospace MAS is proposed. The core idea is the separation of strategy generation and data computation. In the strategy generation phase, the strategy that supports various missions with adaption to the features of aerospace MAS (i.e., decentralized and dynamic environment) can be computed distributedly by diffusing the task model and network information to the network. In the data computation phase, the data is processed step by step and the mission can be accomplished by orchestrating the resources of agents based on the strategy. Moreover, the sequence diagram of the proposed framework is demonstrated and the use cases are discussed. Through analysis, the proposed framework can provide a generic approach that can be applied to performing various missions with adaptation to the decentralized and dynamic environment.","","979-8-3503-9603-4","10.1109/FCN60432.2023.10543695","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10543695","Dispersed collaboration computing framework;aerospace multi-agent system;task-agnostic","Industries;Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Collaboration;Aerodynamics;Task analysis;Aerospace industry","","","","23","IEEE","7 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, this popular software paradigm is increasingly used for the performance evaluation of server systems. Due to the scale and complexity of datacenters, the evaluation of server optimization techniques is usually done on a smaller scale using a client-server model. Although the experimental details of the server side are excessively described in most publications, the client side is often ignored. This paper identifies the hardware configuration of the client side as an important source of performance variation that can affect the accuracy and the correctness of the conclusions of a study that analyzes the performance of microservices. This is partially attributed to the strict latency requirements of microservices and the small scale of the experimental environment.In this work we present, using a widely used online-service, several examples where the accuracy and the trends of the conclusions differ based on the configuration of the client-side. At the same time we show that the experimental evaluation time can be significantly affected by the hardware configuration of the client.

Unlike traditional delta encoding, which transmits differences between sequential data points, our approach is to transmit differences relative to baselines determined by time windows and unique identifiers. These baselines are stored in a shared registry, ensuring they are accessible to both producers and consumers for consistency and synchronization. In all distributed experiments, we use setups based on message brokers, and we aim to maintain the robustness and scalability of the messaging infrastructure while reducing the volume of transmitted data. We hypothesize that MDE can reduce message size by 20 % and overall latency by at least 10 %. Through a series of experiments and performance evaluations across diverse scenarios, we assess the efficacy of this approach in reducing latency and improving space efficiency. Our results are promising, showing a significant reduction in the serialized size of up to 44 % and median inter-service latency of up to 32 % compared to regular Avro encoding in certain scenarios.","","979-8-3315-2056-4","10.1109/TCSET64720.2024.10755788","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10755788","delays;encoding;information exchange;low latency communication;message-oriented middleware;performance evaluation","Performance evaluation;Scalability;Distributed databases;Market research;Encoding;Robustness;Telecommunications;Synchronization","","","","11","IEEE","25 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Container orchestration platforms can help counteract this trend by optimally placing applications across the infrastructure to increase resource utilization and reduce energy consumption. But platforms in use today are still energy-agnostic and do not offer any insights into energy consumption. In this paper, we present a monitoring framework and a new modeling approach for resource usage in data centers. The model captures heterogeneous hardware and software and acts as input for a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to predict power consumption. Based on this model, we derive a set of container scheduling algorithms that opportunistically schedule applications based on the estimated energy impact of incoming containers. Our results show that the GNN-based prediction model is very accurate and achieves an average RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of 7.5%. We have implemented a custom scheduler to demonstrate the benefits of using our prediction, and our scheduler can decrease energy consumption on average by 6.2% without any code changes for the application and without increasing workload completion time compared to the default Kubernetes scheduler.","2993-2114","979-8-3503-9566-2","10.1109/CCGrid59990.2024.00042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10701405","GNN;Energy estimation;energy-aware scheduler","Energy consumption;Data centers;Schedules;Power demand;Scheduling algorithms;Containers;Predictive models;Graph neural networks;Data models;Software","","","","43","IEEE","8 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, restricting accelerator placement to these locations limits both the variety of ULPs that can be accelerated and the overall performance. In particular, it overlooks the opportunity to accelerate ULPs running atop a stateful transport protocol in the face of high cache contention. That is, at high network rates, the frequent DRAM accesses and SmartNIC-CPU synchronizations outweigh the benefits of hardware acceleration. This work introduces SmartDIMM, which unlocks the opportunity for accelerating ULPs running atop stateful transport protocols that primarily operate on data stored in DRAM. We prototyped SmartDIMM using Samsung's AxDIMM and implemented endto-end offloading of (de/en)cryption and (de)compression– two ULPs widely employed in datacenters. We then compared the performance of SmartDIMM with accelerator placements on the CPU, SmartNIC, and PCIe cards. Our results demonstrate that ULP offloading on SmartDIMM outperforms CPU, SmartNIC and PCIe-based offload configurations. In comparison to a server executing (de/en)cryption and (de)compression on the CPU, SmartDIMM achieves 21.0% to 10.28 × higher requests per second and 36.3% to 88.9% lower memory bandwidth utilization.","2378-203X","979-8-3503-9313-2","10.1109/HPCA57654.2024.00032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10476416","Processing near-memory;Datacenter-scale systems and architectures;End-host Networking","Transport protocols;Performance evaluation;Random access memory;Computer architecture;Bandwidth;Programming;Servers","","","","97","IEEE","2 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typically, different IoT devices will be allocated to the same Fifth Generation (5G) mobile network slice, on which the IoT services will be using different containers. While cloud containers can offer many benefits, they also introduce new security risks from co-resident containers that can be particularly problematic for IoT devices. The need for long-lasting batteries is essential for the success of wireless-connected IoT devices, particularly in applications where regular battery replacement is impractical or impossible. Energy Depletion Attacks (EDA) can drastically reduce the lifespan of IoT sensor device batteries, whereas Synergistic Power Attacks (SPA) can cause power outages in data centers and disrupt critical services. Although EDA and SPA have been studied in the literature, the IoT cloud information leakages with the advent of network slicing concepts in 5G and 6G leading to these attacks have not been addressed yet. This paper presents comprehensive studies of 5G-Advanced IoT cloud framework and related attacks. It reveals novel systematic methods through which powerful stealth Cloud Container-Based EDA (CC-EDA) and Cloud Container-Based SPA (CC-SPA) can be launched. These attacks are difficult to detect as the attacker impersonates a valid IoT management system and manipulates the system’s behavior. With a quantitative assessment of the performance of a battery under attack, this paper additionally shows that an aggressive CC-EDA will be deeply damaging and can bring down the entire IoT network within a day.

In such contexts, precise time and timeliness in task execution are fundamental requirements for emerging IoT applications and new experiences. Industry 4.0, mobile and collaborative robots, autonomous systems, and immersive and interactive human-cyber experiences are only examples of IoT-based domains where precise time, computing, and communication with bounded latencies are strictly required. Furthermore, these applications might be time-critical and safety-critical as they often involve interactions between humans and machines. Such stringent time and safety requirements bring new practical challenges and opportunities to revolutionize computing and communication infrastructure's traditional design, deployment, and management. New concepts in software-defined systems and networks, cloud/edge computing, Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), Wi-Fi 6/7, 5G, 6G, dynamic, AI-driven resource orches-tration, and Edge AI are emerging as potential building blocks to enable the transformation of computing and communications infrastructure to enable emerging time-critical applications.","2768-1734","979-8-3503-1161-7","10.1109/WF-IoT58464.2023.10539395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10539395","IoT;Time-Critical Things;TSN;Industrial IoT","","","","","0","IEEE","30 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
