## 📋 Research Questions

This review addresses three main research questions with multiple sub-questions covering the software lifecycle, measurement approaches, architectural solutions, and trade-offs.

→ See [`research-questions.md`](research-questions.md) for complete details.

## 🔍 Search Strategy

Database searches conducted on Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library (2015-2025).

→ See [`1-paper-extraction/search-string.md`](1-paper-extraction/search-string.md) for search queries.

## 📊 Key Notebooks

- [`1-paper-extraction/combine.ipynb`](1-paper-extraction/combine.ipynb) - Combine papers from different databases
- [`2-screenings/2-preliminary-screening/combine-datasets.ipynb`](2-screenings/2-preliminary-screening/combine-datasets.ipynb) - Merge screening rounds
- Screening automation scripts in `2-screenings/` directories

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook/Lab
- ASReview (for screening)
- OpenAI API key (for automated screening, optional)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:eoanodea/slr.git
cd slr

# Create .env file with your API keys (if using automation)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials

# Install dependencies (if requirements.txt exists)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
