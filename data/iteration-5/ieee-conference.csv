Despite the standardization efforts and wide adoption of Web standards and cloud computing technologies, however, building large-scale Smart City IoT platforms in practice remains challenging. The dynamically changing IoT environment requires these systems to be able to scale and evolve over time adopting new technologies and requirements. In response to the similar challenges in building large-scale distributed applications and platforms on the Web, micro service architecture style has emerged and gained a lot of popularity in the industry in recent years. In this work, we share our early experience of applying the micro service architecture style to design a Smart City IoT platform. Our experience suggests significant benefits provided by this architectural style compared to the more generic Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) approaches, as well as highlights some of the challenges it introduces.","","978-1-4673-8103-1","10.1109/FiCloud.2015.55","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7300793","","Smart cities;Computer architecture;Data models;Standards;Architecture;Interoperability","","161","","27","IEEE","26 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Interestingly, containers offer the possibility of handling workload fluctuations by exploiting both horizontal and vertical elasticity ""on the fly"". However, most of the existing control policies consider horizontal and vertical scaling as two disjointed control knobs. In this paper, we propose Reinforcement Learning (RL) solutions for controlling the horizontal and vertical elasticity of container-based applications with the goal to increase the flexibility to cope with varying workloads. Although RL represents an interesting approach, it may suffer from a possible long learning phase, especially when nothing about the system is known a-priori. To speed up the learning process and identify better adaptation policies, we propose RL solutions that exploit different degrees of knowledge about the system dynamics (i.e., Q-learning, Dyna-Q, and Model-based). We integrate the proposed policies in Elastic Docker Swarm, our extension that introduces self-adaptation capabilities in the container orchestration tool Docker Swarm. We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of model-based RL policies through simulations and prototype-based experiments.","2159-6190","978-1-7281-2705-7","10.1109/CLOUD.2019.00061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8814555","Reinforcement Learning, Elasticity, Self adaptation, Container, Docker","Elasticity;Containers;Adaptation models;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;System dynamics;Tools","","99","","24","IEEE","29 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cloud infrastructure and accelerators that offer INFerence-as-a-Service (INFaaS) have become the enabler of this rather quick and invasive shift in the industry. To that end, mostly accelerator-based INFaaS (Google's TPU [1], NVIDIA T4 [2], Microsoft Brainwave [3], etc.) has become the backbone of many real-life applications. However, as the demand for such services grows, merely scaling-out the number of accelerators is not economically cost-effective. Although multi-tenancy has propelled datacenter scalability, it has not been a primary factor in designing DNN accelerators due to the arms race for higher speed and efficiency. This paper sets out to explore this timely requirement of multi-tenancy through a new dimension: dynamic architecture fission. To that end, we define Planaria1 that can dynamically fission (break) into multiple smaller yet full-fledged DNN engines at runtime. This microarchitectural capability enables spatially co-locating multiple DNN inference services on the same hardware, offering simultaneous multi-tenant DNN acceleration. To realize this dynamic reconfigurability, we first devise breakable omni-directional systolic arrays for DNN acceleration that allows omni-directional flow of data. Second, it uses this capability and a unique organization of on-chip memory, interconnection, and compute resources to enable fission in systolic array based DNN accelerators. Architecture fission and its associated flexibility enables an extra degree of freedom for task scheduling, that even allows breaking the accelerator with regard to the server load, DNN topology, and task priority. As such, it can simultaneously co-locate DNNs to enhance utilization, throughput, QoS, and fairness. We compare the proposed design to PREMA [4], a recent effort that offers multi-tenancy by time-multiplexing the DNN accelerator across multiple tasks. We use the same frequency, the same amount of compute and memory resources for both accelerators. The results show significant benefits with (soft, medium, hard) QoS requirements, in throughput (7.4×, 7.2×, 12.2×), SLA satisfaction rate (45%, 15%, 16%), and fairness (2.1×, 2.3×, 1.9×).","","978-1-7281-7383-2","10.1109/MICRO50266.2020.00062","Google; Qualcomm; Microsoft; Xilinx; National Science Foundation; Air Force Office of Scientific Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9251939","Accelerators;Deep Neural Networks;DNN;DNN Acceleration;Multi-Tenancy;Spatial DNN Task Co-Location;Multi-Tenant DNN Acceleration;Dynamic Architecture Fission;Omni-Directional Systolic Arrays","Industries;Microarchitecture;Computer architecture;Quality of service;Throughput;Acceleration;Task analysis","","49","","124","IEEE","11 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many organizations choose to host their microservices architectures in cloud data centres to offset costs. Incidentally, data centres become over-encumbered during peak usage hours and underutilized during off-peak hours. Traditional microservice scaling methods perform either horizontal or vertical scaling exclusively. When used in combination, however, these methods offer complementary benefits and compensate for each other's deficiencies. To leverage the high availability of horizontal scaling and the fine-grained resource control of vertical scaling, we developed two novel hybrid autoscaling algorithms and a dedicated network scaling algorithm and benchmarked them against Google's popular Kubernetes horizontal autoscaling algorithm.

However, emerging techniques often result in the violation of Quality-of-Service (QoS) of microservice-based services in cloud-edge continuum, as they do not consider the communication overhead or the resource contention between microservices.We propose Nautilus, a runtime system that effectively deploys microservice-based user-facing services in cloud-edge continuum. It ensures the QoS of microservice-based user-facing services while minimizing the required computational resources. Nautilus is comprised of a communication-aware microservice mapper, a contention-aware resource manager and a load-aware microservice scheduler. The mapper divides the microservice graph into multiple partitions based on the communication overhead and maps the partitions to the nodes. On each node, the resource manager determines the optimal resource allocation for its microservices based on reinforcement learning that may capture the complex contention behaviors. The microservice scheduler monitors the QoS of the entire service, and migrates microservices from busy nodes to idle ones at runtime. Our experimental results show that Nautilus reduces the computational resource usage by 23.9% and the network bandwidth usage by 53.4%, while achieving the required 99%-ile latency.","1530-2075","978-1-6654-4066-0","10.1109/IPDPS49936.2021.00102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9460542","","Distributed processing;Runtime;Quality of service;Computer architecture;Reinforcement learning;Bandwidth;Resource management","","33","","38","IEEE","28 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore we set the ultimate goal of making cloud-based web applications' management easier and more effective. We propose a Kubernetes scaling engine that makes the auto-scaling decisions apt for handling the actual variability of incoming requests. In this engine various AI-based forecast methods compete with each other via a short-term evaluation loop in order to always give the lead to the method that suits best the actual request dynamics, as soon as possible. We also introduce a compact management parameter for the cloud-tenant application provider in order to easily set their sweet spot in the resource over-provisioning vs. SLA violation trade-off. The multi-forecast scaling engine and the proposed management parameter are evaluated both in simulations and with measurements on our collected web traces to show the improved quality of fitting provisioned resources to service demand. We find that with just a few competing forecast methods, our auto-scaling engine, implemented in Kubernetes, results in significantly less lost requests with slightly more provisioned resources compared to the default baseline.","","978-1-7281-6095-5","10.1109/CCGrid49817.2020.00-33","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9139654","cloud computing;artificial intelligence;auto-scaling;Kubernetes;forecast;resource management","Cloud computing;Containers;Adaptation models;Servers;Engines;Measurement;Resource management","","32","","30","IEEE","14 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We introduce ANT-Man, an Auto, Native and Transparent power Management framework that can exploit fine-grained microservice variability for system efficiency. To achieve this, ANT-Man abstracts away two major sources of latency overhead in traditional hierarchical power management frameworks. First, ANT-Man proposes an auto power budgeting scheme for reducing the power coordination latency at the datacenter level. It can proactively determine the power budget tailored to each individual microservice. Second, ANT-Man proposes a native and transparent power control scheme to overcome the power configuration latency for each microservice. It enables super-fast power budget enforcement with nanosecond-scale performance scaling. Extensive experiments on our prototyped system show that ANT-Man could slash power consumption by $ 7.8\sim 43.5\%$ and in the meantime reduce the $95^{\text{th}}$ tail latency by $ 9.7\sim 12.5\%$ compared to existing techniques.","","978-1-7281-9998-6","10.1109/SC41405.2020.00082","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9355316","microservice;variability;power management","Power demand;Power system management;Power control;Market research;Large-scale systems;Optimization;Next generation networking","","26","","79","IEEE","22 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We observe that datacenter schedulers are agnostic of these emerging accelerators, especially their resource utilization footprints, and thus, not well equipped to dynamically provision them based on the application needs. We observe that the state-of-the-art datacenter schedulers fail to provide fine-grained resource guarantees for latency-sensitive tasks that are GPU-bound. Specifically for GPUs, this results in resource fragmentation and interference leading to poor utilization of allocated GPU resources. Furthermore, GPUs exhibit highly linear energy efficiency with respect to utilization and hence proactive management of these resources is essential to keep the operational costs low while ensuring the end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) in case of user-facing queries.Towards addressing the GPU orchestration problem, we build Knots, a GPU-aware resource orchestration layer and integrate it with the Kubernetes container orchestrator to build Kube- Knots. Kube-Knots can dynamically harvest spare compute cycles through dynamic container orchestration enabling co-location of latency-critical and batch workloads together while improving the overall resource utilization. We design and evaluate two GPU-based scheduling techniques to schedule datacenter-scale workloads through Kube-Knots on a ten node GPU cluster. Our proposed Correlation Based Prediction (CBP) and Peak Prediction (PP) schemes together improves both average and 99th percentile cluster-wide GPU utilization by up to 80% in case of HPC workloads. In addition, CBP+PP improves the average job completion times (JCT) of deep learning workloads by up to 36% when compared to state-of-the-art schedulers. This leads to 33% cluster-wide energy savings on an average for three different workloads compared to state-of-the-art GPU-agnostic schedulers. Further, the proposed PP scheduler guarantees the end-to-end QoS for latency-critical queries by reducing QoS violations by up to 53% when compared to state-of-the-art GPU schedulers.","2168-9253","978-1-7281-4734-5","10.1109/CLUSTER.2019.8891040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8891040","","Graphics processing units;Containers;Measurement;Task analysis;Quality of service;Resource management;Correlation","","24","","64","IEEE","7 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of the Cloud-IoT solutions focus on centralized data collection and storage which is not appropriate for efficient data collection and utilization. For addressing such diverse set of requirements,resources are placed near to the data sources for processing and fast real-time decision making instead of sending all the data to the Cloud. The gateway is such a type of edge device that collects data from smart sensors, but it does not have any pre-processing or decision-making capabilities. Therefore, the gateway has to be made smarter with Fog capabilities and named as Fog Smart Gateway(FSG).

The processing of IoT traffic is taken care of by Virtual Machines(VMs) facilitated by distributed mini-clouds/Fog nodes and located within the edge devices. We optimized the number of mini-clouds placement to reduce the total latency and power consumption induced by traffic aggregation and processing. However, there has been little research on fog node placement.

However, various studies advocate that the existing DCs are often underutilized. To be precise, almost 30% of the installed DCs in the United States are comatose. In addition to this, the existing DC architecture leads to extensive energy utilization, which severely hampers the environment and places a severe risk on the power sector. Thus, it is highly essential to reduce DC's energy utilization through efficient resource consolidation approaches. In this work, we investigate the joint impact of resource consolidation and load balancing on cutting down the energy utilization indices of the cloud DCs. In this vein, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) for container placement across heterogeneous infrastructure, primarily with the intent to minimize the overall energy consumption and balance the load amongst the operating hosts. However, due to the hardness of the underlying problem and its infeasibility to furnish optimal solutions in polynomial time, we designed an online solution based on the incremental exploration of the solution space to map containers on the available array of hosts such that the objectives mentioned above can be attained. Finally, we evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm in contrast to an existing algorithm on real-time workload traces obtained from PlanetLab.

So an attempt is made to develop an intelligent system for industrial hazard monitoring using IoT which will be useful to the society by reducing the effects of hazard to a great extent. So keeping this in mind an IoT based hazard monitoring system is implemented using raspberry-pi as the gateway node which receives the data from a heterogeneous network to monitor the readings of different nodes. Sensor data is stored into a MySQL database using MQTT as the messaging protocol. Also focus is laid on periodically collecting the data which can be accessed by the end users using a dynamic web page with an option for graphical view of the data. Moreover, a notification system using AWS IoT platform is implemented for alert situations. Furthermore, interoperability among the end nodes is taken into account by proposing a method which will remove the dependency on a particular vendor along with its own data format.","","978-1-5386-2456-2","10.1109/ICIRCA.2018.8597430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8597430","IoT (Internet of Things);Industrial hazard;Raspberry pi;nRF24L01;XBee;Interoperability;MQTT;AWS IoT","Hazards;Protocols;Monitoring;Logic gates;Cloud computing;Interoperability;Internet of Things","","12","","18","IEEE","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One major appeal of cloud computing is its capability of abstracting hardware resources and making them easy to use. Conversely, one of the major challenges for cloud providers is the energy efficiency improvement of their infrastructures. Aimed at overcoming this challenge, heterogeneous architectures have started to become part of the standard equipment used in data centers. Despite this effort, heterogeneous systems remain difficult to program and manage, while their effectiveness has been proven only in the HPC domain. Cloud workloads are different in nature and a way to exploit heterogeneity effectively is still lacking. This paper takes a first step towards an effective use of heterogeneous architectures in cloud infrastructures. It presents an in-depth analysis of cloud workloads, highlighting where energy efficiency can be obtained. The microservices paradigm is then presented as a way of intelligently partitioning applications in such a way that different components can take advantage of the heterogeneous hardware, thus providing energy efficiency.

In reality, however, devising an effective consolidation method to host multiple Lambda functions into a single machine is challenging. The existing simple resource allocation algorithms, such as the round-robin policy used in many commercial server-less systems, suffer from lack of responsiveness to a sudden surge in the incoming workload. This will result in an unsatisfactory performance degradation that is directly experienced by the end-user of a Lambda application. In this paper, we address the problem of CPU cap management in a Lambda platform for ensuring different QoS enforcement levels in a platform with shared resources, in case of fluctuations and sudden surges in the incoming workload requests. To this end, we present a closed-loop (feedback-based) CPU cap controller, which fulfills the QoS levels enforced by the application owners. The controller adjusts the number of working threads per QoS class and dispatches the outstanding Lambda functions along with the associated events to the most appropriate working thread. The proposed solution reduces the QoS violations by an average of 6.36 times compared to the round-robin policy. It can also maintain the end-to-end response time of applications belonging to the highest priority QoS class close to the target set-point while decreasing the overall response time by up to 52%.","2168-9253","978-1-5386-8319-4","10.1109/CLUSTER.2018.00041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8514884","Server-less computing, FaaS (Function as a Service), QoS-aware resource manager, Dynamic CPU usage control","Quality of service;Instruction sets;Delays;Time factors;Surges;Resource management","","12","","27","IEEE","1 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different deployments of distributed software components on heterogeneous servers can lead to significant differences in power consumption, depending on the server allocation and the current workload. As workloads and load intensity change, components may be re-deployed or exchanged in order to reduce the power consumption for the current load profile. The decision on which component to place on which server during run-time remains difficult as the power consumption that would result from such a placement remains unknown. Existing work on component deployment optimization at run-time focuses on maximizing performance or considers power in the context of static design time decisions. In this paper, we introduce a model to predict the power consumption of component placements at run-time based on the load and power profile collected for a running distributed application in a heterogeneous environment. In addition, we present a model that enables the use of our approach without dedicated power measurement devices, predicting power consumption based on load intensity and performance counters.

In this paper, we design Goldilocks, a novel resource provisioning system for optimizing both power and task completion time by allocating tasks to servers in groups. Tasks hosted in containers are grouped together by running a graph partitioning algorithm. Containers communicating frequently are placed together, which improves the task completion times. We also leverage new findings on power consumption of modern-day servers to ensure that their utilizations are in a range where they are power-proportional. Both testbed implementation measurements and large-scale trace-driven simulations prove that Goldilocks outperforms all the previous works on data center power saving.

Containers enabled the adaptation of the application capacity to the changing workload on the finer level of granularity than it was possible only with virtual machines. The common way to automate the adaptation of a cloud application is via autoscaling. Autoscaling is provided both on the level of virtual machines and containers. Its accuracy on dynamic workloads suffers significantly from the reactive nature of the available autoscaling solutions. The aim of the paper is to explore potential improvements of autoscaling by designing and evaluating several predictive-based autoscaling policies. These policies are naive (used as a baseline), best resource pair, only-Delta-load, always-resize, resize when beneficial. The scaling policies were implemented in Scaling Policy Derivation Tool (SPDT). SPDT takes the long-term forecast of the workload and the capacity model of microservices as input to produce the sequence of scaling actions scheduled for the execution in future with the aims to meet the service level objectives and minimize the costs.

Although this offers many advantages, such as easy management and deployment, the approach still has many limitations. For example, when a connection between a drone and a GCS has some problems, the quality of service cannot be maintained. Many drone and UAV-based systems do not support flexibility, transparency, security, and traceability.

Hence, this work presents an architecture for Quantum Computing in the edge-cloud continuum. We discuss the necessity, challenges, and solution approaches for extending existing work on classical edge computing to integrate QPUs. We describe how warm-starting allows defining workflows that exploit the hierarchical resources spread across the continuum. Then, we introduce a distributed inference engine with hybrid classical-quantum neural networks (QNNs) to aid system designers in accommodating applications with complex requirements that incur the highest degree of heterogeneity. We propose solutions focusing on classical layer partitioning and quantum circuit cutting to demonstrate the potential of utilizing classical and quantum computation across the continuum. To evaluate the importance and feasibility of our vision, we provide a proof of concept that exemplifies how extending a classical partition method to integrate quantum circuits can improve the solution quality.

Despite accelerating microservice diversity, there is a strong requirement to limit diversity in underlying server hardware to maintain hardware resource fungibility, preserve procurement economies of scale, and curb qualification/test overheads. As such, there is an urgent need for strategies that enable limited server CPU architectures (a.k.a “SKUs”) to provide performance and energy efficiency over diverse microservices. To this end, we first undertake a comprehensive characterization of the top seven microservices that run on the compute-optimized data center fleet at Facebook. Our characterization reveals profound diversity in OS and I/O interaction, cache misses, memory bandwidth utilization, instruction mix, and CPU stall behavior. Whereas customizing a CPU SKU for each microservice might be beneficial, it is prohibitive. Instead, we argue for “soft SKUs”, wherein we exploit coarse-grain (e.g., boot time) configuration knobs to tune the platform for a particular microservice. We develop a tool, μSKU, that automates search over a soft-SKU design space using A/B testing in production and demonstrate how it can obtain statistically significant gains (up to 7.2% and 4.5% performance improvement over stock and production servers, respectively) with no additional hardware requirements.","2575-713X","978-1-4503-6669-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8980331","Microservice;resource fungibility;soft SKU","","","9","","118","","6 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This allows for much simpler and faster application orchestration and management, especially in cloud-based systems, with the result being that orchestration systems themselves are becoming a key focus of computing research.Orchestration system research addresses many different subject areas, including scheduling, automation, and security. However, the key characteristic that is common throughout is the complex and dynamic nature of distributed, multi-tenant cloud-based microservice systems that must be orchestrated. This complexity has led to many challenges in areas such as inter-service communication, observability, reliability, single cluster to multi-cluster, hybrid environments, and multi-tenancy.The concept of service meshes has been introduced to handle this complexity. In essence, a service mesh is an infrastructure layer built directly into the microservices - or the nodes of orchestrators - as a set of configurable proxies that are responsible for the management, observability, and security of microservices.Service meshes aim to be a full networking solution for microservices; however, they also introduce overhead into a system - this can be significant for low-powered edge devices, as service mesh proxies work in user space and are responsible for processing the incoming and outgoing traffic of each service. To mitigate performance issues caused by these proxies, the industry is pushing the boundaries of monitoring and security to kernel space by employing eBPF for faster and more efficient responses.We propose that the movement towards the use of service meshes as a networking solution for most of the required features by industry - combined with their integration with eBPF - is the next key trend in the evolution of microservices. This paper highlights the challenges of this movement, explores its current state, and discusses future opportunities in the context of microservices.","2642-6587","978-1-6654-7534-1","10.1109/SOSE55356.2022.00027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9912629","Service-Oriented Computing;Microservice;Service Mesh;eBPF","Industries;Runtime;Service-oriented systems engineering;Microservice architectures;Software;Complexity theory;Security","","9","","101","IEEE","13 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The full exploitation of 5G relies on network slicing, a network virtualization technique where operators split a physical network among a wide number and variety of services, in accordance to their individual needs. However, experimentation with 5G-enabled services and measurement of key performance indicators (KPIs) over network slices is extremely challenging as it requires the deployment and coordination of numerous physical devices, including edge and cloud resources. In this paper, we introduce 5G-Slicer; an open and extensible framework for modeling and rapid experimentation of 5G-enabled services via a scalable network slicing emulator. Through modeling abstractions, our solution eases the definition of 5G network slices, virtual and physical fog resources, and the mobility of involved entities. With the blueprint of an emulated testbed at hand, users can create reproducible experiments to evaluate application functionality and KPIs by injecting load, faults and even changing runtime configurations. To show the wide applicability of 5G-Slicer, we introduce a proof-of-concept use-case that encompasses different scenarios for capacity management in a city-scale intelligent transportation service.

In this paper, we present LOCUS, an H2020 project (https://www.locus-project.eu/) funded by the European Commission, aiming at the design and implementation of an innovative location management layered platform which will be able to: i) improve localization accuracy, close to theoretical bounds, as well as localization security and privacy, ii) extend localization with physical analytics, iii) extract value out from the combined interaction of localization and analytics, while guaranteeing users' privacy.","2575-4912","978-1-7281-4355-2","10.1109/EuCNC48522.2020.9200961","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9200961","","5G mobile communication;Computer architecture;3GPP;Virtualization;Software;Europe;Security","","8","","35","IEEE","21 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This enables serverless cloud providers to reduce their resource usage by transparently aggregate similar tasks of a certain context (e.g., video processing) that share the whole or part of their computation. To this end, it is crucial to know the amount of time-saving achieved by aggregating the tasks. Lack of such knowledge can lead to uninformed merging and scheduling decisions that, in turn, can cause deadline violation of either the merged tasks or other following tasks. Accordingly, in this paper, we study the problem of estimating execution-time saving resulted from merging tasks with the example in the context of video processing. To learn the execution-time saving in different forms of merging, we first establish a set of benchmarking videos and examine a wide variety of video processing tasks-with and without merging in place. We observed that although merging can save up to 44% in the execution-time, the number of possible merging cases is intractable. Hence, in the second part, we leverage the benchmarking results and develop a method based on Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) to estimate the time-saving for any given task merging case. Experimental results show that the method can estimate the time-saving with the error rate of 0.04, measured based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).","","978-1-7281-7649-9","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS50907.2020.00004","Louisiana Board of Regents; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9407824","Task Merging;Oversubscription;Serverless;Cloud Computing;Video Stream Processing;Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT)","Processor scheduling;Merging;Measurement uncertainty;Streaming media;Benchmark testing;Boosting;Decision trees","","8","","22","IEEE","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, the reactive nature of the existing autoscaling solutions provided by major Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud services providers (CSP) heavily limits the ability of cloud applications for self-adaptation. The major reason of such limitations is the necessity for the manual configuration of the autoscaling rules. With the evolution of monitoring systems, it became possible to employ the data-driven approaches to derive the parameters of scaling rules in order to enable the autoscaling in advance, i.e. the predictive autoscaling. The change in the amount of requests to microservices could be considered as a reason to adapt the virtual infrastructure underlying the cloud application. By forecasting the amount of requests to cloud application, it is possible to estimate the upcoming demand to replicate the microservices in advance. Hence, anticipation of the demand on the cloud application helps to evolve its self-adaptive properties. In the scope of the paper, the authors have tested various extrapolation models on the real anonymized requests time series data for 261 microservices provided by the industry partner Instana. The tested models are: various seasonal ARIMA models with GARCH modifications and outliers detection, exponential smoothing models, singular spectrum analysis (SSA), support vector regression (SVR), and simple linear regression. In order to evaluate the accuracy of these models, an interval score was used. The time required to fit and use each model was also evaluated. Comparative results of this research and the classification of forecasting models based on the interval accuracy score and model fitting time are provided in the paper. The study provides an approach to evaluate the quality of forecasting models to be used for self-adapting cloud applications and virtual infrastructure.","1949-3681","978-1-5386-5172-8","10.1109/SASO.2018.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8614278","requests forecasting;self-adaptive cloud;microservice;seasonal ARIMA;GARCH;SSA;SVR","Forecasting;Time series analysis;Predictive models;Cloud computing;Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Smoothing methods","","8","","25","IEEE","17 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, novel security mechanisms such as accurate and efficient intrusion detection systems (IDSs), taking into consideration the inherent limitations of the I0MT networks, are required to be developed before I0MT networks reach their full potential in the market. In our previous works, we presented the system architecture of a novel hybrid anomaly-based IDS (AIDS) for I0MT networks and the implementation of its prototype.

Therefore, in this paper, we present the development of a functional IoT/IoMT security testbed for testing and evaluating AIDSs.

Although simulation plays a pivotal role in niche cases, it is an undervalued tool in the broader enterprise context. Its proliferation has not kept up with recent technological advances such as big data, cloud computing, graphics processing units clusters, and cross-layer enterprise integration. Based on such new developments, new capabilities can be realized that go beyond single-purpose simulations, and are an excellent fit for studying heterogeneous, independently developed System-of-Systems (SoS), in a multitude of scenarios in complex and dynamic enterprise environments. Co-simulation efforts can provide new insights on the enterprise operations including compelling visualizations of possible simulated alternatives, thereby assisting decision makers in their strategy selection. To move beyond niche applications, however, simulated systems need to integrate in real-time, a continually increasing amount of data (both real and simulated), stemming from various domains and their systems. This work presents a way to achieve such distributed simulations in modern enterprise environments, based on HighLevel Architecture (HLA), as well as their coordination via the Run-Time Infrastructure (RTI). In an example scenario featuring a co-simulation of a corporate electric vehicle fleet, it is shown how various software subsystems interact to enable business users to visually investigate scenarios, as well as how such a system can be deployed and operated within a modern enterprise IT landscape.","2474-2325","978-1-5386-3615-2","10.1109/SII.2019.8700423","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8700423","","Containers;Computer architecture;Tools;Data visualization;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Data models","","7","","21","IEEE","29 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we introduce ALPACA, a framework to reduce QoS violations and overall application performance degradation for consolidated services. ALPACA reduces unnecessary high power consumption when there is no performance gain, and divides the power among the running services in a way that reduces the overall QoS degradation when the power is scarce. We evaluate ALPACA using four applications: MediaWiki, SysBench, Sock Shop, and CloudSuite's Web Search benchmark.

Centralised methods for dynamic service placement in MEC require central access to control every server, which is challenging where servers belong to different administrative domains. Other approaches use distributed decision-making, but most of them do not consider cooperation between servers. Dynamic, distributed service placement can potentially provide workload orchestration and higher QoE. However, this is challenging where service demand patterns are non-stationary. This paper proposes a multi-armed bandit-based method where servers cooperatively decide to host service replicas by applying reinforcement learning that uses service characteristics and context information to minimise response time and backhaul traffic. By sharing cached services, the servers achieve better workload distribution while autonomously making placement decisions. The simulations demonstrate improvements in response time and reduction in backhaul traffic compared to close baselines.","2474-2473","978-1-6654-1683-2","10.1109/SCC53864.2021.00037","Science Foundation Ireland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9592440","Mobile edge computing;Reinforcement learning;Service caching;Service offloading;Service orchestration","Costs;Distance learning;Simulation;Decision making;Service computing;Reinforcement learning;Network architecture","","6","","36","IEEE","15 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

New and constantly evolving use cases continue to place performance demands, especially for low latency communications, as these are still challenges for the 3GPP-specified 5G design, and will have to be met by the 6G design. Therefore, it is helpful to re-examine several aspects of the current cellular network’s design and implementation.Based on our understanding of the 5G cellular network specifications, we explore different implementation options for a dis-aggregated 5G core and their performance implications. To improve the data plane performance, we consider advanced packet classification mechanisms to support fast packet processing in the User Plane Function (UPF), to improve the poor performance and scalability of the current design based on linked lists. Importantly, we implement the UPF function on a SmartNIC for forwarding and tunneling. The SmartNIC provides the fastpath for device traffic, while more complex functions of buffering and processing flows that suffer a miss on the SmartNIC P4 tables are processed by the host-based UPF. Compared to an efficient DPDK-based host UPF, the SmartNIC UPF increases the throughput for 64 Byte packets by almost 2×. Furthermore, we lower the packet forwarding latency by 3.75× by using the SmartNIC. In addition, we propose a novel context-level QoS mechanism that dynamically updates the Packet Detection Rule priority and resource allocation of a flow based on the user context. By combining our innovations, we can achieve low latency and high throughput that will help us evolve to the next generation 6G cellular networks.","","978-1-6654-6763-6","10.1109/6GNet54646.2022.9830519","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9830519","Cellular core;Low latency;SmartNIC","6G mobile communication;Cellular networks;Technological innovation;5G mobile communication;Scalability;Quality of service;Tunneling","","6","","34","IEEE","21 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the resource allocation and placement of VNFs in the network is a multifaceted decision problem that depends on many factors, including VNFs resource demand characteristics, arrival rate, configuration of underlying infrastructure, available resources and agreed Quality of Services (QoS) in Service Level Agreements (SLAs). This paper presents a bottom-up open-source NFV analysis platform (NFV-Inspector) to (1) systematically profile and classify VNFs based on resource capacities, traffic demand rate, underlying system properties, placement of VNFs in the network, etc. and (2) extract/calculate the correlation among the QoS metrics and resource utilization of VNFs.

In addition, many different types of services need to provide mobility and consequently need to be migrated live. These can be offloaded algorithms from mobile devices, such as unmanned vehi-cles or robots, security services, communication services or classic control tasks. In particular, the latter place very high demands on determinism and latency. Here, it is of utmost importance that the downtime of the service is as low as possible. Since existing live migration approaches try to optimize multiple metrics such as downtime, migration time as well as energy consumption, which are equally relevant in the IT domain, it is not possible to use any of these approaches without adoptions. Therefore, a novel concept is proposed that builds on top of both existing migration approaches as well as virtualization technologies and aims primarily at minimizing service downtime. Furthermore, the concept is evaluated using a test environment. The results show that a sub-millisecond downtime can be achieved with the proposed concept. Moreover, the total migration time is in the range of several hundred milliseconds for the highest performance setting and two seconds for a non-invasive approach.","2163-5145","978-1-6654-8240-0","10.1109/ISIE51582.2022.9831601","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9831601","Live migration;Redeployment;container;control services;real-time;industrial automation;IT-OT convergence;mo-bility;flexibility","Measurement;Service robots;Mission critical systems;Process control;Real-time systems;Mobile handsets;Fourth Industrial Revolution","","5","","24","IEEE","25 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fine-granular resource management guarantees better computing resource usage, which is critical to reducing energy consumption and resource wastage (vital in edge computing). In this paper, we propose a novel Zero-touch management (ZSM) framework featuring a fine-granular computing resource scaler in a cloud-native environment. The proposed scaler algorithm uses Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) models to predict microservice performances; if a service degradation is detected, then a root-cause analysis is conducted using eXplainable AI (XAI). Based on the XAI output, the proposed framework scales only the needed (exact amount) resources (i.e., CPU or memory) to overcome the service degradation. The proposed framework and resource scheduler have been implemented on top of a cloud-native platform based on the well-known Kubernetes tool. The obtained results clearly indicate that the proposed scheduler with lesser resources achieves the same service quality as the default scheduler of Kubernetes.","2693-9789","979-8-3503-9980-6","10.1109/NetSoft57336.2023.10175438","AC3; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10175438","Zero-touch Service Management (ZSM);Cloud-native;Containerized Microservices;Machine Learning;Explainable Artificial Intelligence","Degradation;Energy consumption;Memory management;Microservice architectures;Learning (artificial intelligence);Predictive models;Prediction algorithms","","5","","16","IEEE","13 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, cloud-native applications emerged in the last few years and fostered the adoption of the cloud computing model across many organizations. Cloud-native workloads are highly heterogeneous, co-located and latency-sensitive and are able to scale to a high number of machines. To properly manage their power consumption, within this paper we propose Power REgulator for Service Time Optimization (PRESTO), a latency-aware power-capping orchestrator. PRESTO defines an Observe Decide Act (ODA) loop to manage power consumption and average latency of microservice-based workloads by considering all the network interactions between microservices in the cluster. PRESTO reduces the power consumption by 37.13% on average with a control error that is below 12.5% and below 1.5ms on average w.r.t. an unconstrained execution.","","978-1-7281-7277-4","10.1109/ACSOS49614.2020.00021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9196364","Autonomic power management;Latency awareness;Container orchestration","Servers;Power demand;Cloud computing;Monitoring;Measurement;Containers;Instruments","","4","","29","IEEE","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Server, as backbone of cloud computing, has been developing and evolving with diverse challenges of preserving data integrity, increasing availability, minimizing planned downtime, especially in high temperature ambient (HTA) data center environment So, rock robust server system design for reliability, availability, and serviceability (RAS) are crucial for cloud service providers. Memory errors in server are among the most common hardware causes of machine crashes in production sites with large-scale systems. The higher temperature environment, the more errors. The typical response to memory failures is to replace any affected memory modules, which makes memory modules among the most commonly replaced server components. So, memory failures and their correction are very costly. Based on data collection and failure analysis from Baidu infrastructure maintenance group, server system memory (uncorrectable error) failure rate is Top 1 in data center. For reducing memory failure rate and related server downtime, Baidu developed an advanced server handling memory correctable and uncorrectable errors throughout a ""6 pillars"" complete application stack, from the underlying hardware to the scheduling system. Such solutions involve three components: (1) reliability, how the solution preserves data integrity; (2) availability, how it guarantees uninterrupted operation with minimal degradation; and (3) serviceability, how it simplifies proactively and reactively dealing with failed or potentially failed components. Availability is not an independent vector. This paper addresses Baidu rack server memory RAS architecture and design, scoping from Intel Xeon processor hardware errors avoidance, detection and correction RAS features for system reliability and improves fault tolerance; failure identification and reconfiguration such as leakage bucket based software-enhanced error recovery and error containment; extending to kernel level page retirement as well as high availability scheduler. Also, Memory RAS system design specific for HTA data center environment is detail introduced. Then, the related lab test procedure, data, and observations are summarized at the end of each section. Overall conclusion and future work plan are summarized in the end.","2577-0799","978-1-7281-9764-7","10.1109/ITherm45881.2020.9190253","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9190253","Reliability;Availability;and Serviceability (RAS);Memory;Advanced Double Device Data Correction;Hwpoison;Recovery and Containment;High Temperature Ambient (HTA)","Data centers;Servers;Error correction codes;Reliability;Circuit faults;Data integrity;Cloud computing","","4","","7","IEEE","10 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the implementations of this model is a system that is maintained automatically without any human intervention. The path to NoOps involves not only precise and fast diagnostics but also reusing as much knowledge as possible after the system is reconfigured or changed. The biggest challenge is to leverage knowledge on one IT system and reuse this knowledge for diagnostics of another, different system. We propose a framework of weighted graphs which can transfer knowledge, and perform high-quality diagnostics of IT systems. We encode all possible data in a graph representation of a system state and automatically calculate weights of these graphs. Then, thanks to the evaluation of similarity between graphs, we transfer knowledge about failures from one system to another and use it for diagnostics.

Traditional resource provisioning strategies, such as configuring a cluster per peak utilization, lead to low resource efficiency. Serverless computing is a promising way to avoid wasteful resource provisioning since video analytics regularly encounters bursty input workloads and finegrained video content dynamics. For serverless-based video analytics, the application configuration (frame rate, detection model, and computation resources) will impact several metrics, such as computation cost and analytics accuracy. In this paper, we investigate the joint configuration adjustment problem for video knobs and computation resources provided by the serverless platform. We propose an algorithm that can efficiently adapt configurations for video streams to address two key challenges in serverless-based video analytics systems, including the complex relationships between the configurations and the key performance metrics, and the dynamically best configuration. Our algorithm is developed based on Markov approximation to minimize the computation cost within an accuracy constraint. We have developed a prototype over AWS Lambda and conducted extensive experiments with real-world video streams.

It is particularly challenging to perform this task on the potentially limited resources of an sUAS. We therefore propose AirSight, as a new model that hierarchically combines multiple CV models, exploits both onboard and off-board computing capabilities, and engages humans interactively in the search. For illustrative purposes, we use AirSight to show how a person's image, extracted from an aerial video can be matched to a basic description of the person.

Furthermore, these systems do often not restrict themselves to specific data latency requirements. To address this issue, this paper presents the Database & Analytics (DB&A), an open reference implementation for a MDM system that is instantiated as a web service. Its design is based on a set of design goals, an explicitly addressed data latency scope and five real-world scenarios. We present an abstract model of the metering hierarchy that allows MDM systems to be used as compositional services, forming a service tree. Moreover, we provide implementation details about analytic functions to support the service tree.

One major challenge that edge intelligence faces is maintaining a satisfactory quality of service when users move across edge servers. To address this issue, we propose a novel solution to help improve the quality of inference services for real-time video analytics applications that use chained DNN models. This solution includes two schemes: one maximizes the use of mobile devices to improve inference quality during the handover between edge servers, and the other provides offloading decisions to minimize the end-to-end inference delay when edge servers are available. We evaluate the proposed scheme using a DNN-based realtime traffic monitoring application through testbed and simulation experiments.

The design of such systems bears high risk due to uncertainty in requirements related to service function and behavior, operation environments, and evolving customer needs. Such risks and uncertainties are well known in the IT sector, where DevOps principles ensure continuous system improvement through reliable and frequent delivery processes. A modular and service-oriented system architecture complements these processes to facilitate IT system adaptation and evolution.Objective: This work proposes a method to use and extend the Digital Twins (DTs) of IPSS assets for enabling the continuous optimization of CPS service delivery and the latter’s adaptation to changing needs and environments. This reduces uncertainty during design and operations by assuring IPSS integrity and availability, especially for design and service adaptations at CPS runtime.Methodology: The method builds on transferring IT DevOps principles to DT-enabled CPS IPSS. The chosen design approach integrates, reuses, and aligns the DT processing and communication resources with DevOps requirements derived from literature.Results: We use these requirements to propose a DT-enabled self-adaptive CPS model, which guides the realization of DT-enabled DevOps in CPS IPSS. We further propose detailed design models for operation-critical DTs that integrate CPS closed-loop control and architecture-based CPS adaptation. This integrated approach enables the implementation of A/B testing as a use case and central concept to enable CPS IPSS service adaptation and reconfiguration.Conclusion: The self-adaptive CPS model and DT design concept have been validated in an evaluation environment for operation-critical CPS IPSS.

Power Quality Data Logger adds time as another variable and enables students to visualize and measure power quality or distortions over time. If PQA is compared to a still photo camera, then PQL can be compared to a movie camera. The main idea was to extend the functionality of the predecessor in the way that data could be recorded or streamed in real time, allowing the user to analyze them on-site or off-site, in real time or later.

There is no curative treatment due to a lack of understanding of the pathophysiology. Early detection with a proper customized rehabilitation program can slow the disease’s progression and extend their independent living. Furthermore, the objective and real-time monitoring of gait patterns is also important as it can be used to adjust treatment programs and follow up the clinical progress effectively. However, the assessment nowadays is typically depending on a subjective FOQ questionnaire. This paper proposes a low-cost wearable IMU sensor that integrates cloud computing technology to monitor and assess PD patients’ gait. The device uses a single IMU sensor, which combines a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer, to record dynamic acceleration and perform gravity compensation. The preliminary results from 14 patients show that the proposed device can display freezing episodes and variability or decreased acceleration correlated with falling risk.

To this end, applying artificial intelligence to model the behavior can play a key role in improving operational efficiency and over-consumption detection. Most of the energy over-consumption detection approaches make use of external devices such as smart plugs or designed for smart buildings rather than computing devices. Through this paper, a new architecture is proposed in which we extract real-time execution traces after identifying the suspicious running applications using the dynamic binary instrumentation technique. The output of this step is fed to a data analytic framework to detect any behavioral anomalies such as over-threshold energy consumption. Finally, depending on the decision made by the anomaly detection step, some sensors might be switched to the standby mode in order to meet the essential expectations for other sensors or services. Since we have a resource-constrained embedded system and a real-time decision-making constraint on sensor control, the amount of computation that could be done in real-time varies a lot. Accordingly, the desired performance may dictate how, when, and where the processing operations might occur (on the embedded system or on a remote server). This work is mainly focused on anomaly detection operations using tracing data analysis. The experimental results show that the over-consumption detection model achieves a high level of accuracy metrics for classifying abnormal consumption behavior.","","978-1-6654-4231-2","10.1109/ICECET52533.2021.9698794","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9698794","Anomaly Detection;Dynamic Binary Instrumentation (DBI);Tracing;Power Consumption;Energy Consumption;System Call","Energy consumption;Embedded systems;Data analysis;Smart buildings;Instruments;Computational modeling;Switches;Real-time systems;Sensor systems;Anomaly detection","","3","","41","IEEE","11 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So far, adopting cloud computing for time-critical applications and decreasing access delays to resources is difficult. Deep learning has been extensively employed to extract characteristics from complicated networks as artificial intelligence technology has advanced. On the other hand, deep learning models are often run in cloud computing data centres with tremendous processing resources. Conventional cloud computing systems primarily rely on the network, which has significant latency and security and privacy issues. One of the successful solutions is the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) paradigm, which brings cloud computing services closer to the edge network and uses available resources. Mobile edge computing places computer and storage nodes near mobile devices at the Internet's edge, leading to considerable savings in system operating time, memory cost, and power usage. Deep learning is used in mobile edge computing to forecast changes in demand based on daily patient behaviours. It also prepares the network by scaling up network resources as required.

On the other hand, the deployment of a variety of digital services for broadband Internet access may complicate telecom operations. When more digital appliances, such as set-top boxes and IP cameras, are deployed at home, more configurations are required in both CPEs and POPs. CWMP is a management protocol between CPEs and auto configuration servers (ACSs) for remote management of those home network devices. It simplifies the service activation and configuration, and provides functionalities of diagnostics and monitoring. The scalability of ACS is an important issue as more CPEs and more configurations are needed, especially when a lot of Internet of Things (IoT) are widely adopted. This paper focuses on ACS containerization to deliver services quickly and to scale well. To dynamically control and manage the containerize ACS, we propose a middleware approach to support container management and to improve scalability horizontally based on designated policies.","","978-4-88552-304-5","10.1109/APNOMS.2016.7737232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7737232","Virtualization;Container;CWMP;TR-069","Containers;Microprogramming;Computer architecture;Servers;Telecommunications;Virtualization;Resource management","","3","","8","","10 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Smart cities as new technology have attracted the attention of various industry sectors, economy, transportation, urban services, and investment. One of the challenges facing smart city studies is that, after nearly a decade, a comprehensive evaluation plan for smart cities has not been presented.

Also, the analysis of the most effective criteria for presenting a smart city plan using IoT technology and providing a comprehensive view of the smart city, the required security, and its efficient architecture is presented. With modern communications, the loss of costs and economic capital is prevented in the smart city, and human resources are used optimally. The smart city is complex systematic engineering. This requires planning, construction, management, and implementation and evaluation, optimization, and regulation to build a smart city in a forward-looking, logical, and effective way.

The reliable functioning of energy management data platforms is essential for the efficient operation and performance of buildings, as well as the well-being of occupants. The fast-paced digital advances have aided this direction, but they have also created increased challenges for operation disruption mitigation and immutable services and outcomes. Data obtained from energy management systems frequently comprises highly sensitive and personal information. Consequently, access to such data, whether for reading purposes or for conducting experiments and research, must be strictly restricted and clearly defined. Through security frameworks data protection and information privacy, mitigation of risks and vulnerabilities can be ensured. In this paper, an end-to-end Security Framework is proposed for securing sensitive resources in energy management systems using Keycloak, OAuth2 and UMA 2 protocols as well as an extra security layer on top of the Keycloak, so as to enhance the overall security and avoid immediate interaction with Keycloak, which is the main user storage and access management component. The main concept of this framework is the controlled access of sensitive data and services, such as datasets, databases, functionalities, URLs, APIs, etc., leveraging the OAuth2 access tokens capabilities and the roles of the users. Our proposed architecture ensures that all the functionalities of the involved tools and protocols are properly secured end-to-end. The several existing functionalities of a number of tools and related protocols are properly leveraged and further extended, resulting to a fine-grained architecture with an extra security layer that offers administrative, security and identity access management and orchestration.","","979-8-3503-1806-7","10.1109/IISA59645.2023.10345842","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10345842","Authentication;Authorization;encryption;security;Access Management;Access Token;Keycloak;API;REST;OAuth2;UMA2;Energy Management applications;Energy Sector","Protocols;Databases;Data security;Data protection;Solids;Security;Reliability","","3","","28","IEEE","15 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To this end, we present a tool, whose core component is a domain-specific language (DSL) with which a user can specify test oracles at a higher level of abstraction and independent of a testing level. The DSL also supports specifying uncertainty-aware test oracles to test elevators under various uncertainties inherent in them. Finally, the DSL is also equipped with test oracle generation that generates test oracle code automatically at the different DevOps testing levels (i.e., Software and Hardware-in-the-Loop test levels, and in operation) to enable reuse of test oracles across these levels. We evaluated this DSL with an industrial elevators case study at Orona's site to specify and generate test oracles. The evaluation showed that the high expressiveness of the DSL permits the high-level definition of test oracles in our industrial context.

API Request Bundling, which is in focus of this paper, is one of those patterns that aims at optimizing performance. The pattern promises substantial performance gains, but can also lead to significant drawbacks such as increased development effort and application complexity. So far, there is little to no rigorously acquired knowledge to judge whether applying Request Bundling is worth the costs in a given Microservice architecture. To improve this situation, we performed an empirical study based on a Microservice-based open source business application using realistic workload scenarios. To estimate the performance impact of Request Bundling, we derived a regression model and performed a multivariate regression analysis. These selected regression models can help distributed system engineers and architects to estimate the gain in performance, in terms of round-trip time, with or without Request Bundling. Our approach followed in the paper, can be customized to other Microservice architectures or to study other performance-related Microservice patterns.","2474-2473","978-1-6654-1683-2","10.1109/SCC53864.2021.00060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9592439","API Request Bundling;Modeling;Microservices;Cloud;Performance","Costs;Conferences;Service computing;Computer architecture;Performance gain;Reliability engineering;Multivariate regression","","3","","19","IEEE","15 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper investigates a subset of seven design patterns that industrial practitioners indicate as relevant for system performance. We are interested to quantify the impact of these patterns while considering heterogeneous workloads, thus supporting software architects in understanding the root causes of performance issues. We use queuing networks to build the performance models of the seven design patterns and extract quantitative insights from model-based performance analysis. Our performance models are flexible in their input parameterization and reusable in different application contexts. We find that most design patterns confirm the expectation of practitioners, and our experimental results assess the identified performance gains and pains.

However, decision making in current management platforms are addressed separately in different cloud stack layers. These isolated active management decisions may degrade the total performance of the cloud system. Since, cloud computing platforms lack an integrated analytics and management capability, in this paper, we propose an integrated platform to detect and predict situations where corrective actions are required. First, a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) is trained and updated by collected data to calculate the causal dependencies among various entities in different cloud service layers. The correlation values are then fed into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the future states. States that violate the Service Level Agreement(SLA) of cloud services are learned with training data, and if the forecasted states threaten the SLA of cloud services, associated events are generated to trigger management actions. Next, management actions are assigned a different set of events using a reinforcement learning approach. A set of experiments based on collected data from a real cloud service environment is conducted to validate the proposed approach.

The cities, enhanced by the Internet of Things (IoT) advent, are becoming “Smart” thanks to the data generated by IoT devices. The ubiquitous distribution and the possibility of correlating data from different sources (voluntary shared or freeware) have enabled the crowdsourced initiative to realize applications exploiting these data.

Realization and management of these services is assumed to take place centrally, and according to well-defined policies established by city authorities. However, the proliferation of connected devices and crowd-sensing made it possible for ad hoc services to emerge before strict policies and architectures were enforced, and with little provision of interoperability. Furthermore, many existing services in today's cities use networks of privately-owned smart devices, which confine such services to local domains because of ownership and corporate governance. We propose a resource cooperation approach that orchestrates access to connected devices across local domains in order to compose new and potentially large-scale services that are not necessarily bound by local ownership. The resource cooperation approach makes informed recruitment of network segments from local network domains in response to stakeholder queries, which will be posted to a centralized authority responsible for smart city services. Our approach aims at maximizing the utility of city-wide services while maintaining local governance and minimizing performance degradation of service provisioning within local domains. The approach will also facilitate the composition of new smart city services from existing heterogeneous resources, thus minimizing the need to deploy dedicated service infrastructures.","","978-1-4673-8511-4","10.1109/INNOVATIONS.2015.7381505","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7381505","smart city;resource cooperation;orchestration","Smart cities;Recruitment;Cities and towns;Stakeholders;Technological innovation;Pricing;Information technology","","2","","10","IEEE","14 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Usually, the scheduling algorithm considers only a limited sample of the infrastructure nodes, typically obtained through random sampling. The sampling reduces the number of nodes, which need to be evaluated in the scheduling pipeline, making the scheduling process more saleable. Unfortunately, current sampling approaches become largely inefficient when the infrastructure is heterogeneous and specific, scarce node characteristics are required to successfully execute a workload. Computing continuum infrastructures are heterogeneous, hence, we need to re-think the sampling process to keep it viable at scale while also being able to identify and leverage the heterogeneity of the Edge-Cloud continuum resources. In this article, we present Intelligent Sampling - a novel technique for improving sampling in large-scale and heterogeneous infrastructures. We develop a model for any heterogeneous infrastructure. Based on this model, we provide a method to sample the infrastructure nodes more accurately, considering the specific task at hand. Finally, we leverage the Alibaba PAI dataset to show that our approach is 2.5x times more accurate compared with other state-of-the-art sampling mechanisms while retaining comparable performance and scalability.","2642-6587","979-8-3503-2239-2","10.1109/SOSE58276.2023.00024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10254740","Computing continuum;Intelligent sampling;Workloads scheduling;Heterogeneous infrastructure model","Service-oriented systems engineering;Scheduling algorithms;Computational modeling;Scalability;Pipelines;Heterogeneous networks;Complexity theory","","2","","40","IEEE","25 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, leveraging virtualization technology to deploy networks as virtualized network functions (VNFs) garnered attention. It helps the network operators and service providers to consolidate several VNFs on fewer of-the-shelf servers. This results in reducing the capital and operational expenditures while improving the resource efficiency. However, moving network functions from proprietary devices to standard servers comes with the profound cost of performance degradation. In order to overcome any performance issues to ensure service level agreement (SLA) requirements and before taking the solutions to real world, a sufficient verification and validation of VNFs is required. This is where Network Service benchmarking (NSB) plays a crucial role. NSB identifies any performance compromising bottlenecks by systematically evaluating the capacity of general purpose hardware resources, also know as network function virtualization infrastructure (NFVI), used to host single or multiple VNF instances. This paper presents a benchmarking methodology and framework to extract the correlation among the VNF quality of services (QoS) metrics and NFVI key performance indicators (KPls). For evaluation, VoerEir Touchstone platform is used to execute iPerf based benchmarking application to generate UDP based workload between VNFs.

However, there are still many QoS-sensitive use-cases where data and service availability, network latency, and throughput needs to be further addressed. Partial solutions to these problems came in Fog and Edge computing, providing computation and data closer to end-user network devices.

A potential answer to these questions could be the concept of dew computing - an additional layer in the existing client-server architecture, operating on end devices to achieve the highest possible level of data synchronization between data in the cloud and local devices, which in the standard Cloud-Fog-Edge architecture relies strictly on connectivity.

This introduces a single point of failure to the system. The central authority must be trusted to have data stored by the application available at any given time.

A decentralized system could be a solution to remove the dependency from a central authority. Moreover, due to the rapid growth of mobile device usage, the availability of decentralization must not be limited only to desktop computers. In this work we aim at studying the possibility to use mobile devices as a decentralized file sharing platform without any central authorities. This was done by implementing Asterism, a peer-to-peer file-sharing mobile application based on the Inter-Planetary File System. We validate the results by deploying and measuring the application network usage and power consumption in multiple different devices. Results show that mobile devices can be used to implement a worldwide distributed file sharing network. However, the file sharing application generated large amounts of network traffic even when no files were shared. This was caused by the chattiness of the protocol of the underlying peer-to-peer network. Consequently, constant network traffic prevented the mobile devices from entering to deep sleep mode. Due to this the battery life of the devices was greatly degraded.","2573-7562","978-1-7281-0463-8","10.1109/MobileCloud.2019.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8710656","decentralized file sharing;peer-to-peer;mobile;Sailfish OS;InterPlanetary File System","Peer-to-peer computing;Mobile handsets;Protocols;File systems;Servers;Mobile applications;Power demand","","2","","34","IEEE","13 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most PIM architecture papers still focus on best-effort applications, while PIM’s impact on latency-critical cloud applications is not well understood.This paper explores how datacenters can exploit PIM architectures in the context of latency-critical applications. We adopt a general-purpose cloud server with HBM-based, 3D-stacked logic+memory modules, and study the impact of PIM on six diverse interactive cloud applications. We reveal the previously neglected opportunity that PIM presents to these services, and show the importance of properly managing PIM-related resources to meet the QoS targets of interactive services and maximize resource efficiency.

Kubernetes is the de facto standard for container orchestration. It is very efficient in a data center environment, but it fails to give the same performance when adding edge resources. At the edge, resources are more limited, and networking conditions are changing over time.In this paper, we present a methodology that lowers the costs of running applications in the edge-to-cloud computing continuum. A cost-aware scheduler enables this optimization. We are also monitoring the Key Performance Indicators of the applications to ensure that cost optimizations do not impact negatively their Quality of Service. In addition, to ensure that performances are optimal even when users are moving, we introduce a background process that periodically checks if a better location is available for the application. To demonstrate the performance of our scheduling approach, we evaluate it on a vehicle cooperative perception use case, a representative 5G application.","2694-0825","979-8-3503-4394-6","10.1109/IC2E59103.2023.00025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10305811","Cloud computing;Edge computing;Scheduling;Container Orchestration;Resource allocation;5G;Kubernetes","Data centers;Energy consumption;Costs;5G mobile communication;Key performance indicator;Quality of service;Servers","","1","","22","IEEE","6 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, we require new data-driven Machine learning-based resource management approaches that can efficiently capture the interdependencies between parameters and guide resource management systems. This review describes the in-depth analysis of the existing resource management approaches in CDCs for energy and thermal efficiency. It mainly focuses on learning-based resource management systems in data centres and also identifies the need for integrated computing and cooling systems management. A taxonomy on energy and thermal efficient resource management in data centres is proposed.

These devices possess limited computing resources, while edge execution environments are inherently heterogeneous. It is non-trivial to dynamically allocate the limited resources of heterogeneous devices to balance high performance and low resource utilization. To that end, this paper presents a profiling-based methodology that effectively matches edge computational tasks with the available devices to best satisfy programmer-defined non-functional requirements. Edge tasks are divided into microservices, which are then profiled for their resource utilization. To execute each task, the runtime consults the profiling results to determine the optimal device-to-microservice matching. We realize our methodology as μHTA, whose service-oriented architecture manages the heterogeneity of edge environments and optimally executes microservices on the available mobile devices. We evaluated μHTA by applying it to two realistic edge mobile applications.

Optimizing these algorithms directly influences scheduling efficiency and overall application performance. This paper compares several schedulers and sorting algorithms, leveraging extensive benchmark tests conducted on the widely-used Kubernetes (K8s) platform. The evaluation includes a novel sorting algorithm named Topological-Sort, designed to prioritize containers for application scheduling focused on microservice inter-dependencies. Results show the significant impact of queue sorting on application performance, with TopologicalSort algorithms outperforming default mechanisms, yielding an average increase of 20 % in throughput and reducing response time by at least 15 %.

To make SAEAs adapt to these distributed DOPs, this paper employs the edge computing paradigm to develop a platform that provides technical support for SAEAs with distributed structures, named ECdo. Specifically, the platform utilizes KubeEdge, an open-source edge computing framework, to mount the cluster and combines microservice interface design with the containerization strategy to offer a flexible deployment approach for distributed SAEAs. In addition, an efficient and stable internal communication mechanism is designed for the interaction between distributed components within the platform. To demonstrate the application of ECdo, we take the examples of a class of distributed DOPs, in which the objective and constraints are expensive and need to be approximated by accumulated data. These problems are known as distributed and expensive constrained optimization problems (DECOPs). We implement a distributed SAEA on ECdo to address DECOPs in real-world scenarios. Experiments show that the ECdo can provide the expected implementation for distributed SAEAs with good network tolerance under tough network conditions.","2577-1655","979-8-3503-3702-0","10.1109/SMC53992.2023.10394009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10394009","edge computing;surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm;distributed optimization;expensive optimization","Training;Cloud computing;Privacy;Distributed databases;Evolutionary computation;Programming;Stability analysis","","1","","33","IEEE","29 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Depending on the application goals and execution context of the application, the optimal deployment on either cloud server or mobile device varies during the lifetime of an application. In this paper, we propose a context-aware middleware that enables optimization of deployed application software to satisfy the application’s functional goals in accordance with changing execution context and environmental conditions.

It enables proactive and reactive fault tolerance by providing detection of things failures as well as continuous and real-time monitoring of their states. In addition, it offers mechanisms to strengthen the reliability of the designed systems. We lean on formal methods to verify the functioning of H-FaTMA.

Microservices are specialized components of an application that can be deployed and scaled individually, potentially replacing monolithic applications. To meet this demand, cloud providers offer function-as-a-service (FaaS) or serverless computing. Additionally, there is an increasing use of containerized environments in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. It has been shown that implementing serverless computing at the edge of an IoT network for executing tasks can reduce the overall execution time of these tasks. In cloud and edge computing environments, the infrastructure typically exhibits heterogeneity, and this heterogeneity can significantly impact the performance of different invocations of a FaaS function. This paper addresses infrastructure heterogeneity by partitioning a heterogeneous cluster into homogeneous pools based on similar resource characteristics and profiling function performance. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) a serverless architecture design that extends the function placement and load-balancing capabilities of current serverless platforms to effectively manage infrastructure heterogeneity, (2) a load-balancing approach that efficiently utilizes multi-core hardware, and (3) an implementation of the architecture, thereby evaluating the impact of the extended capabilities.","","979-8-3503-6941-0","10.1109/IoT60973.2023.10365354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10365354","Cloud Computing;Edge Computing;function-as-a-service (FaaS);Internet of Things (IoT);infrastructure heterogeneity","Multicore processing;Serverless computing;Microservice architectures;Computer architecture;Market research;Load management;Hardware","","1","","27","IEEE","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Technologies such as Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) can help to build interoperable solutions for the management of complex systems. Probabilistic forecasting, in contrast to deterministic single-point estimators, can offer a different approach to resource allocation by quantifying the uncertainty of the generated predictions. This paper examines the cloud-native aspects of O-RAN together with the radio App (rApp) deployment options. The integration of probabilistic forecasting techniques as a rApp in O-RAN is also emphasized, along with case studies of real-world applications. Through a comparative analysis of forecasting models using the error metric, we show the advantages of Deep Autoregressive Recurrent network (DeepAR) over other deterministic probabilistic estimators. Furthermore, the simplicity of Simple-Feed-Forward (SFF) leads to a fast runtime but does not capture the temporal dependencies of the input data.

Architects find it hard to reason about these trade-offs and the impact that design decisions will have on performance before implementing them. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose an approach that enables rapid evaluation of high-level architectural models by combining both static and dynamic analysis. The static analysis identifies the design anti-patterns that are known to hinder system performance and guides the architect in reasoning about these design decisions. The approach then generates source code for the system under study based on the architectural design model for a subsequent dynamic analysis to assess whether the statically detected anti-patterns do indeed have a negative effect on the performance of the analyzed system.","2768-4288","978-1-6654-6459-8","10.1109/ICSA-C57050.2023.00044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10092669","microservices;design decisions;anti-patterns;performance testing","Analytical models;Software architecture;System performance;Source coding;Microservice architectures;Static analysis;Cognition","","1","","17","IEEE","24 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, numerous computing resources for software execution are available in manufacturing environments. The increased use of software and distributed systems is constantly raising the complexity of the software deployment process. Often, and specifically in manufacturing, software is subject to technological or usage requirements limiting possible resources related to the execution of the software. Since deployment decisions are often made manually without a profound basis, this leads to wrong decisions and to resources not being put to their best use. Also, the performance quality of software execution suffers with security gaps occurring and additional costs arising. Existing software deployment concepts are very generic and focus on cloud. They do not address the specific needs of operational technology and manufacturing environments. This work identifies important evaluation criteria for software deployment in manufacturing environments, based on a requirements analysis. The requirement analysis systematically analyzes cloud, fog, and edge environments, as well as software applications and system resources in manufacturing environments. The aim is to identify deployment-relevant resource properties and software requirements. The comparison, evaluation, elimination, and specification of the collected information results in a catalog of deployment-relevant criteria for selecting technically suitable options for a deployment decision. These criteria support decisions during the software deployment process. Also, these criteria provide the basis for automated and dynamic software deployment decisions in manufacturing environments.","","978-1-6654-9996-5","10.1109/ETFA52439.2022.9921690","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9921690","Software deployment;Requirements analysis;Manufacturing environments","Cloud computing;Costs;Digital transformation;Software;Manufacturing;Complexity theory;Software reliability","","1","","27","IEEE","25 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Compared to existing Kubernetes frameworks and scheduling procedures, the advantages of KOptim are: (i) it facilitates the configuration of container resources using Service Level Agreement (SLA) classes, and (ii) it optimizes the online scheduling of containers using a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) algorithm. In short, the main contribution of KOptim is to simplify Kubernetes scheduler optimization, as well as other issues related to container configuration and validation. In KOptim, we propose to configure and manage container resources using a new model with three SLA classes related to CPUs, memory, and storage space. Each SLA class has three Quality of Services (QoS): Premium, Advanced, and Best Effort. Using the KOptim SLA classes, users can select a range of values for a service instead of specifying a fixed amount of resources for each container. This is designed to help non-expert users who do not need to know exactly how many resources must be used to configure their containers easily. In the scheduling step, we suggest using a mechanism based on a multi-criteria decision algorithm that allows users to consider several criteria during the online scheduling decision. In summary, KOptim is a generic framework for Kubernetes distributions even K3s and MicroK8s which are adapted to Fog and Edge computing. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of our framework to improve performance in terms of runtime and energy consumption.","","979-8-3503-6460-6","10.1109/IPDPSW63119.2024.00159","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10596385","Container technology;Service Level Agreement;Online multi-criteria scheduling;Kubernetes ecosystem","Energy consumption;Processor scheduling;Computational modeling;Quality of service;Containers;MCDM;Resource management","","1","","34","IEEE","26 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An accurate measurement and prediction of airspace density is crucial for a better managed airspace, both strategically and tactically, yielding a higher level of automation and thereby reducing the air traffic controller’s workload. Although the prior approaches have been able to address the problem to some extent, data management and query processing of ever-increasing vast volume of air traffic data at high rates, for various analytics purposes such as predicting aircraft counts, still remains a challenge especially when only linear prediction models are used.In this paper, we present a novel data management and prediction system that accurately predicts aircraft counts for a particular airspace sector within the National Airspace System (NAS). The incoming Traffic Flow Management (TFM) data is streaming, big, uncorrelated and noisy. In the preprocessing step, the system continuously processes the incoming raw data, reduces it to a compact size, and stores it in a NoSQL database, where it makes the data available for efficient query processing. In the prediction step, the system learns from historical trajectories and uses their segments to collect key features such as sector boundary crossings, weather parameters, and other air traffic data. The features are fed into various regression models, including linear, non-linear and ensemble models, and the best performing model is used for prediction. Evaluation on an extensive set of real track, weather, and air traffic data including boundary crossings in the U.S. verify that our system efficiently and accurately predicts aircraft counts in each airspace sector.","2155-7209","979-8-3503-3357-2","10.1109/DASC58513.2023.10311134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10311134","System-Wide Information Management (SWIM);Big Data;Air Traffic Management (ATM);Airspace Capacity;Machine Learning (ML)","Density measurement;Atmospheric modeling;Query processing;Predictive models;Aerospace electronics;Aircraft navigation;Trajectory","","1","","48","IEEE","10 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One main optimization of our method is to maximize the reuse of the originally allocated resources so that the disruption to the running job can be minimized. The scaling procedure is coordinated among nodes through remote procedure calls on Kubernetes for deploying workloads in the cloud. We evaluate our approach using one synthetic benchmark and two production-level MPI-based HPC applications - GRO-MACS and CM1. Our results demonstrate that the benefits of adapting the allocated resources depend on the workload characteristics. In the tested cases, a properly chosen scaling point for increasing resources during execution achieved up to 2x speedup.

The architecture introduces in-network intelligence, designing intelligent agents as the fundamental unit which is used as a building block in autonomous network system design. This work focuses on the dynamic agent placement problems in edge/cloud data centers. Agents are softwarized and intelligent versions of network functions that are traditionally implemented in hardware such as firewalls, packet gateways, etc. This paper, based on a combination of proactive and reactive solutions, considered decision accuracy in developing an intelligent decision algorithm that can be used in the prediction agent design. The proactive decision is based on a deep learning prediction algorithm using time-series workload forecasting. However, in case of unforeseen events that are missing from the historical dataset, the proactive decisions could be less reliable. Therefore, network-state feedback should be considered to determine the current network conditions using the change in instant arrival rate as a reactive decision. Then combining it with the proactive decision should be able to capture the unpredictable traffic spikes. The result is used to determine the number and type of agents to instantiate at a given time in the edge/cloud data centers. Using a public dataset in our algorithms, we predicted the workload request for a few days. The result shows improved decision accuracy over the existing solutions using the appropriate amount of dataset, machine learning models, and rate estimation.","2576-6813","978-1-6654-3540-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM48099.2022.10001516","US National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10001516","","Training;Data centers;Machine learning algorithms;Architecture;Predictive models;Logic gates;Prediction algorithms","","1","","22","IEEE","11 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To tackle this issue, we introduce SLO-Power, a system that coordinates the resource and power scaling techniques to achieve power savings while adhering to service level objectives (SLOs), such as tail latency constraints. Our approach employs a combination of analytic queuing models and feedback-driven techniques to jointly allocate resources and power to cloud applications in an SLO and power-aware manner. We implement a prototype of our system and evaluate it using realistic workloads to demonstrate its ability to harmonize elastic and power scaling, enabling enhanced resource utilization and reduced power consumption while ensuring the application performance.

In this paper, we propose a novel consolidation algorithm that exploits emerging software development paradigms. Our approach enables cloud users to indicate their willingness to apply energy saving mechanisms to some of their virtual resources, hence giving infrastructure managers the ability to apply more efficient workload consolidation and to switch their hardware to very low-power states.

However, the voluminous, dynamic, and heterogeneous nature of IoT traffic imposes complexities on the problems of network flow classification, network traffic analysis, and accurate quantification of the network requirements, thereby making the provisioning of 5G network slices across the application mix a challenging problem. To address these needs, we propose a novel network traffic classification approach that consists of a pipeline that combines Principal Component Analysis (PCA), with KMeans clustering and Hellinger distance. PCA is applied as the first step to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of features while preserving as much of the original information as possible. This significantly reduces the runtime of KMeans, which is applied as the second step. KMeans, being an unsupervised approach, eliminates the need to label data which can be cumbersome, error-prone, and time-consuming. In the third step, a Hellinger distance-based recursive KMeans algorithm is applied to merge similar clusters toward identifying the optimal number of clusters. This makes the final clustering results compact and intuitively interpretable within the context of the problem, while addressing the limitations of traditional KMeans algorithm, such as sensitivity to initialization and the requirement of manual specification of the number of clusters. Evaluation of our approach on a real-world IoT dataset demonstrates that the pipeline can compactly represent the dataset as three clusters. The service properties of these clusters can be easily inferred and directly mapped to different types of slices in the 5G network.","2693-8340","979-8-3503-2281-1","10.1109/SMARTCOMP58114.2023.00034","Siemens; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10207621","Network traffic classification;Unsupervised Machine Learning;Clustering;5G;Dynamic network slicing;Traffic analysis;Machine Learning","Sensitivity;Runtime;5G mobile communication;Network slicing;Pipelines;Clustering algorithms;Telecommunication traffic","","1","","20","IEEE","7 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Increasingly often, such applications have strong requirements regarding data security, quality of service, and scalability. While scalability is typically addressed by leveraging the abundant resources and fair pricing of cloud computing techniques, using a shared environment triggers resistance from developers regarding data security and quality of service. In this work, we present a system that combines a novel technology for data protection, Intel SGX, with a popular, open source tool for managing interactive and data processing applications, Kubernetes, to provide a batch processing system that is easy to use while still providing quality of service and strong confidentiality guarantees.

Elastic services are situation aware and can adapt themselves to the current execution environment dynamically to adhere to their Service Level Objectives (SLOs). This adaptation is achieved through Diversifiable Programming (DivProg), a new programming model which uses function annotations as interface between the service logic, its SLOs, and the execution framework. DivProg enables developers to characterize their services in a way that allows a third-party execution framework to run them with the flow and the parametrization that conforms to changing SLOs. We develop a prototype and perform an experimental evaluation which shows that elastic services can seamlessly adapt to heterogeneous platforms and scale with a wide range of input sizes, while adhering to their SLOs with little programming effort.","2165-963X","978-3-9031-7614-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8584964","IoT;services;adaptive;programming model","Cloud computing;Cameras;Programming;Hardware;Elasticity;Adaptation models;Servers","","1","","25","","23 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In edge computing environments, resource allocation is essential for ensuring the best possible resource utilization while still satisfying application requirements. Traditional resource allocation algorithms, however, struggle to effectively capture the uncertainties and ambiguity associated with resource availability and application needs because of the dynamic and varied nature of edge environments. This research offers a fuzzy logic-based method for planning to allocate resources in edge computing. Fuzzy logic offers a flexible and understandable framework for modeling and reasoning with imperfect and ambiguous data. The suggested method offers a more reliable and adaptable resource allocation system that can successfully address the uncertainties present in edge computing by utilizing fuzzy logic. The resource allocation process incorporates fuzzy membership functions to capture the vagueness of resource availability and application requirements. Fuzzy rules are defined to map the linguistic variables representing resource availability, application demands, and performance objectives to appropriate resource allocation decisions. The fuzzy inference engine then utilizes these rules to make intelligent decisions regarding resource allocation, considering the fuzzy inputs and the system's predefined objectives.","","979-8-3503-4488-2","10.1109/ICAIHC59020.2023.10431439","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10431439","Fuzzy Logic;Edge Computing;Latency aware;Resource Allocation","Fuzzy logic;Uncertainty;Heuristic algorithms;User experience;Planning;Resource management;Edge computing","","1","","23","IEEE","16 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, in the future, when considering destinations beyond lunar orbit, signal delay simply prevents the conventional operational concept of real-time monitoring and control for crewed missions. To overcome those challenges, this paper will introduce METIS, the Mars Exploration Telemetry-driven Information System. METIS is a novel intelligent assistant enabling autonomous operations of crewed spacecraft based on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). METIS is currently being developed at the Columbus Control-Center (Col-CC), which is part of the German Space Operations Center (GSOC). On behalf of the European Space Agency (ESA), Col-CC is responsible for the operation of the Columbus module of the International Space Station (ISS). Columbus was launched on February 7, 2008, docked to the ISS a few days later on February 11 and has been a part of the ISS since then. It is the basis on which METIS is developed. The assistant is designed after John L. Boyds OODA (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act) loop for human decision making, where each function in the model is developed as an individual computerized agent. This paper will introduce the high-level system architecture of this multi-agent-system (MAS), as well as human interaction embedded in the system. Furthermore, we will show each of the agents in greater detail, their functions and the interaction between the agents. Since some agents rely on machine learning (ML) from the field of artificial intelligence (AI) we use multiple data sources from the Columbus module, including but not limited to on-board telemetry, operational data files (ODFs, i.e. procedures), and anomaly reports, to train and test the system. We will highlight how these data sources are brought together and the database we deploy to enable access to the data in a machine-readable format. Since METIS is intended to be used by both ground personnel, as well as on-board crew, we will show how METIS is planned to be utilized within Col-CC and on-board. For this we envision a step-wise approach, where METIS is first used and tested in conjunction with the Columbus simulator to perform certain ground and on-board activities and react to a set of known anomalies. In this first step ground controllers will still be heavily involved in development, to identify areas that need further improvements and further increase the capabilities of the system. This work represents a significant step towards full crew autonomy by supporting quick and reliable decision making in the highly dynamic environment that is human space exploration. AI/ML enabled solutions to new and old challenges have the potential to revolutionize the space sector and METIS represents one possible contribution to make space more accessible to humans, increase system reliability, reduce cost of operations and help prepare for deep space exploration beyond lunar orbit.","1095-323X","979-8-3503-0462-6","10.1109/AERO58975.2024.10521154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10521154","","Space vehicles;Costs;Soft sensors;Decision making;Systems architecture;Real-time systems;Orbits","","","","39","IEEE","13 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If this could be accomplished, its impact on the society would be enormous. This white paper from the IEEE Future Networks CTU Working Group endeavors to highlight the need to consider the CTU requirements in 5G and B5G networks in the standardization process, in the development of the use cases, and affordable solutions. In its Vision 2030 SDG (Sustainability Development Goals) the United Nations has proclaimed access to Internet as basic human right and has said that these goals cannot be achieved without affordable access to Internet by everyone on this planet. While there are numerous projects and initiatives ongoing around the world, these are fragmented and lack the critical mass and coordination to be able to impact the future standards, product development, and cost of deployment otherwise achievable by volume. Although difficult to pin down, to define a threshold for basic connectivity for all is important. But it would need to be flexible to adapt to changing times. It is the goal of the CTU group to create an open platform where the experts can bring their ideas, solutions, and potentially collaborate to create large global projects and influence the network service providers, manufacturers and their governments. This white paper defines the CTU working group's charter, scope, and provides a brief overview of the relevant stakeholders and linkages between them. Then the paper goes into the current status of the CTU landscape and where we want to reach to accomplish the vision of connecting everybody, especially those living in rural and remote areas. We present the various standards and industry fora and how they are interlinked. While technologies are available today, they need to be customized and optimized at the systems level to bring down the cost of the network in order to be affordable. In addition, the content needs to be relevant and in local languages to be useful, not to mention the need to offer innovative human computer interaction (HCI) solutions (that are not text based) so that people who are not literate or are digitally disadvantaged can easily use the devices and consume services. Another important area is that of flexible spectrum allocation regime at the lower range of the spectrum to increase reach and coverage. Use of renewable energy sources will enable deployment in remote areas where there is lack of power grid, or it is intermittent. Thus, this white paper identifies a number of technology gaps to be filled in by 5G and B5G networks, such that access is affordable and content and services are actually consumed by the targeted set of users. Technology aside, the need to develop innovative business models is a must to be commercially sustainable in the long-term. A number of such models, especially designed for the rural population, are proposed, such as Village Level Entrepreneur (VLE) Freemium (Free + Premium), revenue sharing among the chain of service providers, subsidized billing by USOF (Universal Service Obligation Funds). Finally, the white paper presents a 10-year roadmap starting from the current state to 3 years, 5 years and 10 years.","2770-7679","978-1-6654-6250-1","10.1109/FNWF55208.2022.00134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10056704","Digital Divide;5G;B5G;CTU;SDG;IEEE Future Networks;Rural and remote connectivity;United Nations;Societal impact of ICT;Network slicing;Spectrum management;content management;HCI;IoT;TV white space;Satellite;Community networks;VLE;InfoInternet;Internet Lite;Business models","Human computer interaction;Wireless communication;Costs;5G mobile communication;Sociology;Internet;Stakeholders","","","","53","IEEE","8 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Providing such services requires to decide how often to instantiate each component, where to place these instances in the network, how to chain them and route traffic through them. To overcome limitations of conventional, hardwired heuristics, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches for self-learning network and service management have emerged recently. These model-free DRL approaches are more flexible but typically learn tabula rasa, i.e., disregard existing understanding of networks, services, and their coordination.Instead, we propose FutureCoord, a novel model-based AI approach that leverages existing understanding of networks and services for more efficient and effective coordination without time-intensive training. FutureCoord combines Monte Carlo Tree Search with a stochastic traffic model. This allows FutureCoord to estimate the impact of future incoming traffic and effectively optimize long-term effects, taking fluctuating demand and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements into account. Our extensive evaluation based on real-world network topologies, services, and traffic traces indicates that FutureCoord clearly outperforms state-of-the-art model-free and model-based approaches with up to 51% higher flow success ratios.","2374-9709","978-1-6654-0601-7","10.1109/NOMS54207.2022.9789713","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9789713","network management;service management;AI;Monte Carlo Tree Search;model-based;QoS","Training;Monte Carlo methods;Network topology;Stochastic processes;Microservice architectures;Quality of service;Reinforcement learning","","","","54","IEEE","9 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traversing adversary-controlled infrastructure allows DOD’s adversaries to recognize, disrupt, or extract intelligence even from encrypted communications. The resulting arms race of obfuscation vs intelligence techniques has an inherent limitation: with each new obfuscation, DOD can never know if it fools the adversary, or if the adversary is simply lulling DOD into a false sense of security.We believe the next great capability leap for operating through commercial networks will likely come from sophisticated analytics that provide situational awareness of the threats within the communications infrastructure, and implementations that dynamically route communications along benign paths. These systems will restructure communication paths to avoid adversary-controlled infrastructure within the cellular networks and the broader Internet, adding depth to existing DOD defenses and keeping communications unobservable by the adversary.In this paper, we describe our vision for this emerging conceptual framework. We first describe the threat model for DOD communications and use cases that motivate our approach. We then discuss specific threats for each component of the cellular communication infrastructure–—radio access network, mobile core, and Internet–—and our vision for securing communications against those threats. For the radio access network and Internet components, we also describe proofs-of-concept for our proposed approaches, demonstrating their feasibility.","2155-7586","979-8-3503-7423-0","10.1109/MILCOM61039.2024.10773880","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10773880","mobile;wireless;security;5G;emerging concepts","Threat modeling;Privacy;Weapons;Routing protocols;Real-time systems;US Department of Defense;Internet;Substrates;Research and development;Radio access networks","","","","20","IEEE","6 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fall detection is an issue that we have taken up and aim to solve by providing decisions with the lowest feasible delay. We propose a three-stage process that makes use of multimodal data (sensors, video, and pictures). An edge device's convolutional neural network infers the visual data used for the first inference. To improve weight distribution and training speed, the neural network is constructed utilizing transfer learning. The optical flow method removes the background noise and focuses just on the individual by representing moving objects as vector fields. A condensed neural network is able to operate on a resource-constrained edge device. After that, the sensor data is classified by the fog layer using SVM, Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The fog layer also uses visual and sensor data to make the ultimate fall judgment. The ensemble decision-making process relies on the inferences drawn from the fog and edge layers to arrive at this conclusion. Model construction and durable data storage are carried out at the cloud layer. For more accurate evaluations, our work also deals with false negative rates. To do this, we use augmentation of images on the misclassified photos; this improves the classification and adds value to the dataset. Last but not least, the suggested models are containerized for simple deployment, maintenance, and scalability. With an accuracy of 99%, the proposed technique surpassed all of its competitors, including SVM, XGBoost.

First, we carry out the first assessment of recently proposed advanced forecasting techniques by the AI community, namely DLinear and PatchTST, when applied to the prediction of mobile traffic load and number of users connected to a single Base Station (BS). We compare these techniques with the well-known Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) models that are widely adopted in mobile network tasks. Second, we analyze the accuracy tradeoff of these Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques for single-and multi-step prediction horizons. Third, we profile the operation of all these black-box predictors with an EXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) lens by using AIChronoLens, a new tool that links legacy XAI explanations with the temporal properties of the input sequences. We find that DLinear excels in single-step horizon predictions while PatchTST and LSTM are more accurate in multi-step horizon predictions. Our XAI study reveals that, unlike PatchTST and LSTM, DLinear focuses its prediction decisions on a few key samples of the input sequences, which ultimately lets it match the ground truth closely.","2833-0587","979-8-3503-8447-5","10.1109/INFOCOMWKSHPS61880.2024.10620742","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10620742","","Accuracy;Explainable AI;Conferences;Time series analysis;Telecommunication traffic;Open RAN;Predictive models","","","","25","IEEE","13 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This systematic literature review provides a state-of-the-art overview of the newly proposed approaches. It consolidates what is currently known about the level of their empirical evaluation and the extent to which each addresses the threats in the Top 10 list of OWASP. We examined 181 publications, of which 11 articles proposed new approaches to integrating security into the MDE of web applications. Our analysis of these 11 approaches reveals that most of them address the threat of Broken Access Control and that no approach exists that addresses all threats in the Top 10 list. Compared to a decade ago, we could see a clear trend towards using aspect-oriented methods to integrate security into MDE for web apps.

To achieve the efficiency, load forecasting and elastic scaling have become crucial technologies for dynamically adjusting cloud resources to meet user demands and minimizing resource waste. However, existing prediction-based methods lack comprehensive analysis and integration of load characteristics across different time scales. For instance, long-term trend analysis helps reveal long-term changes in load and resource demand, thereby supporting proactive resource allocation over longer periods, while short-term volatility analysis can examine short-term fluctuations in load and resource demand, providing support for real-time scheduling and rapid response. In response to this, our research introduces TempoScale, which aims to enhance the comprehensive understanding of temporal variations in cloud workloads, enabling more intelligent and adaptive decision-making for elastic scaling. TempoScale utilizes the Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise algorithm to decompose time-series load data into multiple Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) and a Residual Component (RC). First, we integrate the IMF, which represents both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations, into the time series prediction model to obtain intermediate results. Then, these intermediate results, along with the RC, are transferred into a fully connected layer to obtain the final result. Finally, this result is fed into the resource management system based on Kubernetes for resource scaling. Our proposed approach can reduce the Mean Square Error by 5.80% to 30.43% compared to the baselines, and reduce the average response time by 5.58% to 31.15%. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in reducing violations of service-level objectives and providing better performance in terms of resource utilization.","2159-6190","979-8-3503-6853-6","10.1109/CLOUD62652.2024.00030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10643916","cloud native;load prediction;auto-scaling;deep learning;mode decomposition;transformer","Cloud computing;Fluctuations;Time series analysis;Noise;Predictive models;Market research;Prediction algorithms","","","","29","IEEE","28 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The majority of traditional clustering mechanisms are not competent to resource elasticity over multiple IoT systems and hence, handling load distribution effectively underutilizes the resources. To address the increasing complexities and constraints of modern IoT systems, adaptive mechanisms are required to implement virtual clustering, which can dynamically optimize performance and resource utilization by responding to real-time network changes and device heterogeneity.The article proposes the design and performance evaluation of adaptive virtual clustering methods tailored to the requirements of emerging IoT edge systems with dynamic environments. The goal is to optimize resource allocation, balance load, and enhance the overall system performance by deploying virtual clusters with the potential of adapting the best to changing network loads as well as device heterogeneity.We developed a multistep approach that combined state-of-the-art clustering algorithms, the K-means and agglomerative clustering, to our insight of Amdahl’s law using meta learning strategies. There are 4 architecture layers in our system: physical device layer, cluster management layer, coordination layer and virtual group. This paper revisits KPIs such as Silhouette Coefficient, Davies-Bouldin Index and Calinski-Harabasz Index under different network loads and performance of the device being considered.The proposed methods achieved better performance than existing clustering algorithms, particularly in high network traffic scenarios. In competitive testing, adaptive virtual clusters with up to 10% better in total performance over traditional clusters at full network load through smart node allocation and leveraging of the virtual memory for better load balancing.Adaptive virtual clustering appears to be a promising fit for the challenges posed by dynamic IoT edge environments. This limber approach yields improved in network efficiency, load distribution and overall network performance. Future work should focus on optimizing these adaptive clustering approaches for extreme network conditions, such as high device churn and congested IoT environments.

Use cases driving this transition for 5G networks focus on the need to support heterogeneous traffic such as enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC), and Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC). On the software and control side, 5G and beyond networks are enabled through Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technologies and leverage the merging of communication and computing. Although not yet in the standardization stage, early thinking on 6G networks focuses on the convergence of physical, human, and digital worlds, including support for: ■ digital twinning (tight synchronization between the physical world and the twin), ■ immersive communication (support of pervasive haptics), ■ cognition (awareness of human intentions, desires, and mood), and ■ connected intelligence (trusted AI everywhere with interaction between virtual representations). All this also needs to be realized in sustainable fashion [1]. With the deployment of novel applications and the expected increase in their usage and demand, the scope of innovation within future networks will be governed by: (a) limitations and boundaries of available resources; (b) limitations of the adaptability of legacy solutions (scalability and flexibility); (c) limitations of available decision making entities (network slice orchestrators and SDN controllers will not be enough); and (d) lack of intelligent management and control solutions for multi-variate optimization. Technologies are available for efficient use and self-adaptive optimization of resources using enablers such as AI-powered autonomic control loops. With ever-increasing complexity expected for beyond-5G networks, there is a necessity for novel design, planning and operations paradigms.

Amid growing awareness on data center carbon emission, more organizations are paying attention to energy-efficient practices in cloud deployment to reduce energy consumption and operational carbon footprint. Modern processors provide fine-grained power scaling capabilities, e.g., Intel Xeon PCPS (PerCore P-States), this paper presented a dynamic energy efficiency management framework to adaptively scale processor core frequency as well as implicated energy consumption in accordance with service quality requirements. In this paper, we discussed hurdles and solutions for applying platform energy intelligence to microservices that are often with intrinsic platform-agnostic. The experiments proved the proposed method can effectively reduce energy consumption with competitive cost benefits without compromising service quality goals.","2690-5965","978-1-6654-7315-6","10.1109/ICPADS56603.2022.00082","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10077892","Microservices;Service Mesh;Per-Core P-States;Service Level Objective (SLO);Service Level Indicator (SLI);Energy Efficiency;Carbon Reduction;Sustainability;Adaptive Control;Core Frequency Scaling","Energy consumption;Program processors;Costs;Power system management;Memory management;Microservice architectures;Tail","","","","12","IEEE","27 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The focus is on the computing infrastructures, such as hyper-scale cloud datacenters, that consume significant power, thus producing increasing amounts of carbon emissions. Our goal is to (1) optimize the usage of green energy sources (e.g., solar energy), which is desirable but expensive and relatively unstable, and (2) continuously reduce the use of fossil fuels, which have a lower cost but a significant negative societal impact. Meanwhile, cloud datacenters strive to meet their customers’ requirements, e.g., service-level objectives (SLOs) in application latency or throughput, which are impacted by infrastructure resilience and availability. We propose a scalable formulation that combines sustainability, cloud resilience, and performance as a joint optimization problem with multiple interdependent objectives to address these issues holistically. Given the complexity and dynamicity of the problem, machine learning (ML) approaches, such as reinforcement learning, are essential for achieving continuous optimization. Our study highlights the challenges of green energy instability which necessitates innovative ML-centric solutions across heterogeneous infrastructures to manage the transition towards green computing. Underlying the ML-centric solutions must be methods to combine classic system resilience techniques with innovations in real-time ML resilience (not addressed heretofore). We believe that this approach will not only set a new direction in the resilient, SLO-driven adoption of green energy but also enable us to manage future sustainable systems in ways that were not possible before.","2833-292X","979-8-3503-9570-9","10.1109/DSN-S60304.2024.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10647103","sustainability;green energy;cloud computing;resilience;machine learning;machine learning resilience","Green energy;Cloud computing;Technological innovation;Carbon dioxide;Solar energy;Green computing;Throughput","","","","50","IEEE","29 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is a fundamental task for homeland security and crime prevention. Some video analytics tasks are being addressed by at the edge processing approach, which combines algorithmic with hardware development, within the camera system design. The at the edge processing approach looks for real-time performance on specific domains and low network bandwidth requirements. However, it implies that the already installed city-camera-network should be replaced and continuously updated since it introduces constraints to analytics capabilities related to cameras' characteristics and functionalities. Thus, city surveillance by the at the edge processing approach requires a large budget, and continuous investment, to keep the system working. In this paper, we present both faced challenges and obtained achievements during the design process of video-analytics-system software architecture. Interoperability, availability, and security were the prioritized quality attributes by the Quality Attribute Workshop method. A microservices and cloud-based design was the result of applying the Attribute Driven Design method, incorporating software engineering sustainability concerns. As a practical advantage, the designed system can work with the already installed city surveillance camera network and allows incorporating video analytics algorithms as the surveillance system evolves. The evaluation combined the functional and operative prototype as well as the ATAM method, according to which approach is more suited to evaluate a specific driver.

It is fundamental to extract value from the information we all are submerged in, thus motivating and supporting the decisions within our cities, which nowadays need transparency and practical evidence. Data visualization tools provide multiple perspectives and are meant to support decision makers, mining available data, with the help of graphical representations in order to ease the emersion of added value, as an initial point from which making inference, reasoning and simulation within our urban environments. And nonetheless, good data visualization provide intuitive evidence. In this paper we introduce a novel 3D urban data analysis framework for the smart city, which exploits the city itself and its buildings to convey data visualization. The novelty is realized thanks to a dynamic geographic tiling which binds the real city structure and the environmental data ""on the fly"", giving the opportunity to see the city changing as the data change. A prototype is proposed, which is based on a micro service architecture, open standards, and an immersive 3D map, aiming to support public decision makers in the process of environmental data analysis. To this extent, the current solution is built on the idea of replicability, accessibility and adaptation: it is location agnostic and does not depend on the particular position where the analysis takes place, it does not need human intervention or adjustments, once the services are instanced, and it is easily accessible, for the interface it is built on a web application.","","978-953-290-105-4","10.23919/SpliTech49282.2020.9243831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9243831","3D Visualization;Data Visualization;Open Source;Open Data;Smart City;WebGL","Three-dimensional displays;Data analysis;Smart cities;Buildings;Data visualization;Tools;Data mining","","","","44","","4 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"High Performance Cloud Ready Parallel Batch Processing using Auto Scaling Containers and Queue Technique","A. Selvaraj","System Architect in SwitchLane Inc, Charlotte, North Carolina, USA",2024 4th International Conference on Sustainable Expert Systems (ICSES),"3 Dec 2024","2024","","","630","639","In order to solve the problems of the current batch processing systems as well as to reduce cost and shorten processing times, an enhanced parallel processing strategy has been introduced. Existing Batch system are running in dedicated servers and at most one Job can be processed at a time. Which results in higher costs. Also, batch jobs run in sequential to avoid duplicate processing of data so it will take more time. Where as in our proposed system we use queue to avoid duplicate and containers to achieve parallel processing and once job completed containers will be decommissioned and no need to pay for cloud provider when not in use. Hence, this proposed system is using queue mechanisms like RabbitMQ and Multiple containers(pods) all the containers can run parallelly and get inputs from queue so that duplicate processing will not happen in parallel processing to complete the job faster. This is achieved by Auto scaling mechanism, and the paper proposes a novel algorithm called Chunk Optimized Processing based on Queue Length (COPQL). Particularly, one of the main parts of this system is the Initiator, whose job it is to read data from source and push messages(data) into the queue as chunks, especially the primary keys from the database. RabbitMQ queues has been utilized by the proposed system, which are configured with specific topics or queues for each job type and set up as a 3-node cluster to ensure fault tolerance. Multiple processors (containerized nodes) have been included in the system for each job type, which can automatically scale based on the new Chunk Optimized Processing based on Queue Length (COPQL) algorithm. Each processor reads a chunk, consisting of a group of primary keys, retrieves the corresponding data from the source database, performs the necessary business processing, and updates the status in the Batch DB upon completion. It is highly notable that other features include a retry mechanism for handling failures in specific chunks, a caching mechanism to improve processing speed, and a tracking mechanism to monitor the batch process and to generate final reports. Importantly, the COPQL algorithm has been designed to achieve Low cost (serverless model) and minimal processing time for batch. Particularly, the system has been implemented by using Python, and the results have been analyzed based on weighted sum completion time and the effect of the number of tasks per user.","","979-8-3315-4036-4","10.1109/ICSES63445.2024.10763354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10763354","Batch job;parallel processing;multiple processors;cloud server;RabbitMQ","Program processors;Costs;Processor scheduling;Databases;Heuristic algorithms;Batch production systems;Containers;Parallel processing;Monitoring;Sorting","","","","20","IEEE","3 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The self-organizing microservice composition model for IoT addresses this need by leveraging decentralized, localized interactions that utilize bio-inspired mechanisms. These mechanisms enable the system to autonomously form complex service compositions with minimal human intervention through emergent behaviour, enhancing the system's flexibility, adaptability, and overall performance.

It is characterized by higher temperatures in urban than in rural area. Generally, there are 2 typical identification methods for UHI: indirect measurement such as remote sensing, and direct measurement such as fixed stations and mobile traverses. Remote sensing is a common approach, especially in Indonesia. However, fixed stations are difficult to establish due to economic factors. A system that collects data from various point of observation to figure out the surrounding area, similar to and an alternative of fixed station, can be beneficial for Indonesia. Therefore, we propose a UHI monitoring system based on Internet of Things (IoT). In the design of low-cost IoT sensor node, sensor boards are encapsulated in enclosure and sensor point tip is covered by custom Stevenson screen to reduce solar radiation. Temperature and humidity data are collected every minute and sent through the internet using MQTT protocol every hour. Gathered and stored data are subscribed automatically using the Amazon Web Service, and an API is provided to access the data. Based on the implementation, we analyze the data and showed that there are distinctions in temperature and humidity between roadway and residential area. The result also showed that this system can retrieve data from a low-cost IoT sensor node that can be collected, stored, and accessed by a cloud service via API.","2155-6830","978-1-6654-0555-3","10.1109/ICEEI52609.2021.9611099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9611099","UHI;IoT;low-cost sensor","Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Temperature distribution;Costs;Web services;Humidity;Thermal pollution","","","","16","IEEE","25 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

IoT varies from other networks because of their unique characteristics. One of the most important problems in these networks is fault tolerance. In Wireless Sensor Networks or IoTs are made with multiple low-energy sensing nodes. The distribution of these sensing nodes is random in the network. Sensor nodes are capable of perceiving and transferring information to the BS (Bottom Station). Data transmission at sensor nodes necessitates a significant amount of energy. As a result, several nodes die due to energy depletion during transmission. To minimize data loss, fault tolerance techniques are employed. In this paper, a variety of fault tolerance routing protocols are examined and their fault tolerance techniques, as well as issues of each technique, are discussed in this paper. Multiple factors generate disruption in IoT systems that all factors are discussed with a short definition. The comparison of various fault tolerance routing protocols is depicted in the paper.

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for container scheduling within Kubernetes clusters, leveraging Graph Attention Networks (GATs) for representation learning. Our proposed method captures the intricate dependencies among containers and services by constructing a representation graph. The deep Q-learning algorithm is then employed to optimize scheduling decisions, focusing on container-to-node placements, CPU request-response allocation, and adherence to node affinity and anti-affinity rules. Our experiments demonstrate that our GATs-based method outperforms traditional scheduling strategies, leading to enhanced resource utilization, reduced service latency, and improved overall system throughput.

Newer mobile generations, optimizations, modernizations, technology changes, and various mergers have been experienced in the past decades. Different drivers continuously shift physical network elements towards software (SW) only deployments in all IP telecommunication networks. The decoupling of application SW from hardware (HW) is accelerated by virtualization. The ‘cloudification’ of legacy telecommunication equipment made communication networks not only more flexible, but also opened new doors. Brand new services became available thanks to the ongoing fusion of two domains: telecommunications and IT (Information Technology). A new era called ‘Telco-Cloud’ was born. One original goal was to use commercial IT computing servers as HW platform hoping cost efficiency. Another expected benefit was the prompt use of existing experience in the operation and maintenance of IT HW in Data Centers. More and more network functions are virtualized on top of IT HW nowadays. However, the strict requirements of the legacy-Physical Network Function (PNF) based-telecommunications mandate special configurations and practices on cloud. The rapidly increasing amount of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) and Cloud-native Network Functions (CNFs) introduces new concepts for dimensioning, deployment, operation, management, and monitoring. Some availability and operability requirements and expectations are inherited from the legacy PNF domain, meanwhile the telecommunication world itself undergoes a continuous change towards Telco-Cloud and 5G/6G. This paper overviews the evolution steps to Telco-Cloud. The challenges in the dimensioning and availability design are discussed, and some concepts and examples are presented on NF and network levels.","2834-8265","979-8-3503-8845-9","10.1109/CoBCom62281.2024.10631212","Nokia CNS; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10631212","Cloud;PNF;VNF;CNF;TAS;dimensioning;capacity;traffic profile;pooling;availability;redundancy","Cloud computing;Roads;Software;Telecommunications;Software reliability;Telecommunication network reliability;Servers","","","","38","IEEE","19 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

CubeSats have been gaining scads of attention worldwide for their affordability and ease of construction by the educational community. To further enhance this, it is imperative for a simple and reliable communication technique and its ability to work on robust missions by enabling CubeSats in intelligent ways. The mission is targeted to be used at LEO; considering the size and some unplumbed areas of the planet, the CubeSats will work in tandem to perform the task of high resolution infrared thermal imaging over a decided area. The paper proposes a technology that can reduce the costs by deploying CubeSats and improving their lifetime and number of missions using TinyML and reprogrammability capabilities. Swarms of CubeSat deployed for this mission can be synchronized, without having any ground support with the help of onboard ML algorithms. Hence, the paper also proposes the use of TinyML for power optimization and efficient solar irradiance orientation. Both of the aforementioned features not only escalate the life of CubeSats but also can become capable of performing other missions during its lifetime. Thus, orbital re-programmability for CubeSats is also being contemplated in the paper. The use of TinyML and orbital reprogrammability can reduce the space debris by bringing in the factor of satellites' reusability and accessing celestial bodies while making the space environment less cluttered. Applying this technology in CubeSat missions has wide prospects in the exploration of different planets' landing site data that can be exploited for future space travel.","","978-1-6654-5699-9","10.1109/CSITSS57437.2022.10026358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10026358","CubeSats;TinyML;Reprogrammability","Space vehicles;Satellites;Costs;Planets;Space debris;Space missions;Synchronization","","","","19","IEEE","31 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we give a comprehensive architectural analysis of the core Blockchain security feature-set and SDN’s virtualization fabric. Then, we introduce a practical Blockchain-based security and privacy-preserving framework, and discuss the design and implementation of the security services for future generation SDN controllers. This is to entice research on the subject from an architectural prospective.","2769-9994","979-8-3503-2967-4","10.1109/WINCOM59760.2023.10322974","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10322974","Blockchain;Direct Acyclic Graph;Software Defined Networking;Security;Privacy;Micro Services;ZeroMQ Messaging","Performance evaluation;Privacy;Wireless networks;Routing;Fabrics;Blockchains;Security","","","","29","USGov","22 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Transportation plays an important role in a city’s ability to address urbanization and create resilient, sustainable, inclusive, and safer cities for all. However, challenges introduced by urbanization will decrease the effectiveness of current transportation methodologies. By utilizing innovations in sensing, computing, and communication along with machine learning and real-time data, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) can advance transportation efficiency and effectiveness. Integrating these technologies into intelligent transportation systems can potentially reduce congestion, pollution, energy consumption, and traffic incidents. This integration is at the forefront of academic and industry research. Although testbeds have been developed for the development, testing, and validation of ITS solutions, existing testbeds focus on narrow aspects of the ITS domain and are unable to support large-scale experimentation and integrations. Additionally, access to resources and data is limited and not remotely accessible to potential researchers. In this paper, we propose a smart city and ITS Testbed-As-A-Service. The testbed is located in downtown Chattanooga, TN, and offers a unified platform for a wide range of ITS applications including connected and autonomous vehicles, wireless communication, cooperative transportation, internet-of-things (IoT), and edge-based AI.","2573-2978","979-8-3503-6248-0","10.1109/BigData62323.2024.10826138","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10826138","Intelligent Transportation Systems;ITS;Smart City;Testbed;IoT","Wireless communication;Technological innovation;Connected vehicles;Smart cities;Transportation;Traffic control;Real-time systems;Sensors;Autonomous vehicles;Testing","","","","18","IEEE","16 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With highly intelligent equipment deployed on fully-automated production lines, even a slight anomaly may seriously impact the entire manufacturing process. However, most industrial data containing slight anomalous features exhibits strong correlations that are not fully exploited by existing machine learning models. In general, the anomaly detection model needs to run within programmable logic controllers (PLCs) since it is the main controller of the intelligent equipment, and PLCs have limited resources making it difficult to execute larger models effectively. To address the challenge, we propose a graph anomaly detection method in programmable logic controllers based on service computing (PCSC). The model establishes a data relationship graph through clustering and then feeds it into a neural network with a symmetric structure consisting of graph convolutional layers and LSTM units. This approach enables the analysis of correlations within industrial data and facilitates the extraction of slight abnormal features. For efficient execution of the model, we establish service computing nodes in the PLCs that support model splitting. We tested the model on several publicly available datasets and an actual dataset from an injection molding production line. The results show that the model performs well on different datasets.","2836-3868","979-8-3503-6855-0","10.1109/ICWS62655.2024.00142","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10707450","anomaly detection;programmable logic controller;service computing;graph neural networks","Adaptation models;Correlation;Computational modeling;Programmable logic devices;Service computing;Computer architecture;Feature extraction;Data models;Anomaly detection;Long short term memory","","","","36","IEEE","15 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Firstly, the index system reflecting the running state of distribution area and line is established, and the characteristic index is transformed into fuzzy label module by using objective statistical ranking strategy. Then, the operation index is extracted on a daily basis to form a collection sample, which is used as a cloud droplet of the cloud model, and the fuzzy representation of the operation index is formed by using the reverse cloud generator. Finally, the fuzzy distance between the operation index and the label template is weighted to sum, and the scoring value of the operation index is obtained.

However, powerful CPUs and GPUs, consume tons of energy and require cooling appliances, which results into higher operating cost and as an indirect consequence, higher pollution and global warming.

However, instrumenting and configuring the observability of a microservice application is not trivial but tool-dependent and tied to costs. Practitioners need to understand observability-related tradeoffs in order to weigh between different observability design alternatives. Still, these architectural design decisions are not supported by systematic methods and typically just rely on”professional intuition”. To assess observability design tradeoffs with concrete evidence, we advocate for conducting experiments that compare var-ious design alternatives. Achieving a systematic and repeatable experiment process necessitates automation. We present a proof-of-concept implementation of an experiment tool - Observability eXperiment eNgine (OXN).

This paper seeks to comprehend anomalies and current anomaly detection approaches across diverse industrial sectors. Additionally, it aims to pinpoint the parameters necessary for identifying anomalies via runtime monitoring data. Therefore, we conducted semi-structured interviews with fifteen industry participants who rely on anomaly detection during runtime. Additionally, to supplement information from the interviews, we performed a literature review focusing on anomaly detection approaches applied to industrial real-life datasets.

Sharp enables and facilitates a comprehensive characterization of the performance distribution of an application, while orchestrating experiments efficiently. Sharp addresses these key challenges using (a) robust performance analysis and comparison with Similarity Metrics; (b) the automatic determination of a reliable sample size through a diverse set of Stopping Rules; and (c) comprehensive recording of experimental conditions and results.We showcase the need for and advantages of Sharp by evaluating the performance of 20 Rodinia benchmarks on 3 HPC servers with different CPU and GPU configurations. We empirically evaluate Sharp to expose the need for distribution-based statistics, and demonstrate how the stopping rules of Sharp attain reliable performance results while minimizing resource usage up to ∼90% relative to a large fixed number of experiments sufficient enough to establish ground-truth.

Exposure to such threats grows when IaaS is deployed on distributed computing nodes at the edge. This work identifies a potential vulnerability of low-power CPUs that facilitates stealing the deep neural network architecture without physical access to the hardware or interference with the execution flow. Our approach relies on a Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) side-channel attack, which monitors the CPU frequency state during the inference stages.

Continuum systems are dynamic, often massive in scale, and feature disparate infrastructure providers and platforms; this greatly increase the complexity of developing and managing applications. The Serverless paradigm shows the potential to greatly simplify the process of building Continuum applications - however, current scheduling mechanisms for Serverless Continuum platforms pay little attention to reducing the energy consumption and improving the sustainability of function execution. This is a significant omission, made worse as computing nodes within a Continuum may be powered by renewable energy sources that are intermittent and unpredictable, making low-powered and bottleneck nodes unavailable.There is great opportunity to design a decentralized energy management scheme for scheduling Serverless functions that takes advantage of the different layers of the Continuum, such as IoT devices located at the Edge, on-premises clusters closer to the data sources, or directly on large Cloud infrastructures. To achieve this, we formally model a green energy-aware Serverless workload scheduling problem for the multi-provider Cloud-Edge Continuum. We then design stable matching based technique for decentralized energy management (utilising a distributed controller) that considers the availability of green energy nodes and the QoS requirements of Serverless functions.

In the realm of container scheduling, the Multi-Objective Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization (MOAPSO) algorithm emerges as a more effective solution compared to the standard Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, particularly when tasked with scheduling a substantial number of containers. Its scalability proves to be a standout feature, positioning MOAPSO as a versatile tool capable of efficiently scheduling in Internet of Things (IoT) applications within expansive cloud environments.

One of the computing industry's fastest-growing approaches is cloud computing. It is a cutting-edge method for providing IT service over the World Wide Web. Through the Internet, this concept offers computing resources to users in a pool. Resource scheduling and allocation for various aggregate web services is a crucial and challenging problem in cloud computing. This research looks at resource allocation using scalable computing. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), or the service of renting out computer resources through the Internet, is offered to users by cloud computing. The client can select from a variety of computing resources depending on their needs. This approach uses the IaaS model to allocate resources for real-time tasks. Real-Time jobs must be finished ahead of schedules. Elasticity or scalable computing refers to the ability to scale up the resource in this situation in accordance with the demands. The resources are scalable and open to a vast user base. In order to finish real-time work ahead of schedules, the user can choose any number of Virtual Machines (VMs) based on speed and rate. The client leases the virtual machines. Hence the fee is set just for the duration of the rental. Additionally, a method is devised to assign VMs to programs with real-time tasks. The allocation is presented as a problem of restricted optimization.","","979-8-3503-4757-9","10.1109/ICECAA58104.2023.10212395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10212395","Cloud computing;Scalable computing;Demand;Timeline;Resource allocation;Infrastructure as a service","Cloud computing;Schedules;Web services;Processor scheduling;Real-time systems;Virtual machining;Resource management","","","","15","IEEE","16 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, platooning introduces significant computational challenges, such as real-time data handling, vehicle communication, and adapting to dynamic environments. These challenges necessitate advanced computational methods for effective task management. Machine Learning (ML) techniques are employed to determine the most suitable server for offloading tasks. This decision is supported by a workload prediction algorithm that forecasts the next slot's workload. We develop a task offloading approach using Random Forest models to predict workload, considering current server attributes and historical data. This enables us to schedule tasks on the best server in a dynamic environment. Our simulation results demonstrate significant improvements (up to 90%) in task success rates.

As traffic congestion is a major problem in the majority of cities around the world, keeping smart traffic flow on the roads is essential as it helps both citizens and security agencies. The traffic signals continuously turn green or red, and the signals for traffic need to change based on how many vehicles are present in the area. The green lights should be on longer in situations where there is a lot of traffic going in one way, and the red lights should stay on longer in situations where there is less traffic. The first should be given to emergency vehicles like ambulances and fire extinguishing engines. Consequently, the idea suggested here is a system in which the length of the green and red light timings is controlled by the volume of traffic at that particular time. If an emergency vehicle is in a lane, that lane is cleared before any other. The implementation of IoT technology is key to our solution. It allows for wireless connectivity between devices that can be monitored and controlled from anywhere, at any time. We use this technology to connect IR sensors that measure the density of vehicles on the road. Additionally, a camera takes pictures of emergency vehicles which are processed in the server by using image processing techniques where the image is processed and calibrated so that signal is sent to the server. The information about emergency vehicles and the density of traffic on each road is then sent to a microcontroller, specifically the ESP32. The microcontroller uses this information to determine the optimal time for green lights, thereby reducing traffic and pollution.","","979-8-3315-4068-5","10.1109/IConSCEPT61884.2024.10627923","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10627923","IoT technology;vehicle density;infrared sensors;ESP32 cam module","Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Microcontrollers;Roads;Urban areas;Signal processing;Timing","","","","12","IEEE","22 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional load management methods have high requirements for data accuracy and real-time performance, as well as difficulties in dealing with diverse load characteristics. Therefore, it is particularly urgent to seek a method that can more effectively identify and manage load characteristics. This article proposes a load management method based on clustering technology to address the problems of traditional methods. This method includes steps such as data preprocessing, feature selection, clustering analysis, and interpretation of clustering results. By effectively classifying and managing load data, it is possible to achieve better utilization of energy and improvement of system efficiency. The purpose of this study is to explore a load management method suitable for the Internet of Things environment. Through the application of clustering technology, accurate identification and management of load characteristics have been achieved. The proposal of this method provides new ideas for load management in the energy field, and has important theoretical and practical significance.

If this could be accomplished, its impact on the society would be enormous as everyone would have access to information and an opportunity to improve their quality of life and income. This chapter from the IEEE Future Networks CTU Working Group endeavors to highlight the need to consider the CTU requirements in 5G and B5G networks in the standardization process and in the development of the use cases and affordable solutions. In its Vision 2030 SDG (Sustainability Development Goals) the United Nations has proclaimed access to internet as basic human right and has said these goals cannot be achieved without affordable access to internet by everyone on this planet[65]. While there are numerous projects and initiatives ongoing around the world, these are fragmented and lack the critical mass and coordination to be able to impact the future standards, product development, and cost of deployment otherwise achievable by economy of scale. Although difficult to pin down, to define a threshold for basic connectivity for all is important. But it would need to be flexible to adapt to changing times. It is the goal of the CTU group to create an open platform where the experts can bring their ideas, solutions, and potentially collaborate to create large global projects and influence the network service providers, manufacturers and their governments. This paper defines the CTU working group's charter, scope, and provides a brief overview of the relevant stakeholders and linkages between them. Then the paper goes into the current status of the CTU landscape and where we want to reach to accomplish the vision of connecting everybody, especially those living in rural and remote areas. We present the various standards and industry fora and how they are interlinked. While technologies are available today, they need to be customized and optimized at the systems level to bring down the cost of the network to be affordable. In addition, the content needs to be relevant and in local languages to be useful, not to mention the need to offer innovative human computer interaction (HCI) solutions (that are not text based) so that people who are not literate or are digitally disadvantaged can easily use the devices and consume services. Another important area is that of flexible spectrum allocation regime at the lower range of the spectrum to increase reach and coverage. Use of renewable energy sources will enable deployment in remote areas where there is lack of power grid, or it is intermittent. Thus, this paper identifies a number of technology gaps to be filled in by 5G and B5G networks, such that access is affordable and content and services are actually consumed by the targeted set of users. Although hitherto unexplored, artificial intelligence (AI) an machine learning (ML) have tremendous role to play for serving the rural and remote communities both to deliver the most needed services and to customize them to the digital capacity of the end users. Technology aside, the need to develop innovative business models is a must to be commercially sustainable in the long-term. A number of such models, especially designed for the rural population, are proposed, such as Village Level Entrepreneur (VLE) Freemium (Free + Premium), revenue sharing among the chain of service providers, subsidized billing by USOF (Universal Service Obligation Funds). Finally, the paper presents a 10-year roadmap starting from the current state to three years, five years, and ten years.","2770-7679","979-8-3503-2458-7","10.1109/FNWF58287.2023.10520445","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10520445","Digital Divide;5G;B5G;CTU;SDG;IEEE Future Networks;Rural and remote connectivity;United Nations;Societal impact of ICT;Network slicing;Spectrum management;content management;HCI;IoT;TV white space;Satellite;Community networks;VLE;InfoInternet;Internet Lite;Business models","Human computer interaction;Wireless communication;Renewable energy sources;Costs;5G mobile communication;Product development;Stakeholders;Resource management;Sustainable development;Standards","","","","65","IEEE","13 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Elastic pod containers attracts and helps the application developers in developing and executing the cloud-native modern applications with key benefits such as light weight, agility to launch, easy deployment through images, consuming less power, minimum cost, less carbon footprints with increased resource utilization and provisioning on public cloud data centers. In existing, reactive auto-scaling mechanism of pod resources is used to add or remove resources manually or rule based for handling static workloads from users and most of the times it may lead to over provision or under provisioning of instances that violates QOS and SLA. In this paper, predictive horizontal scaling of pods utilizing custom metrics with orchestration through Kuberenetes is proposed with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) based on Deep Learning (DL) technique. DL is data hungry for right prediction of replicas of a cluster that is needed in advance to run cyclic workloads and to handle the sudden spike of demand by using the cloud large dataset real time traces. Moreover, LSTM model is compared with GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) and experimental results shows that the results of LSTM prediction has less absolute error rate on comparing with GRU to keep the resource provisioning accuracy better for running the modern workloads seamlessly on public cloud.","","978-1-6654-9710-7","10.1109/ICAAIC53929.2022.9792749","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9792749","Container Virtu aliza tion;Pods;Predictive Scaling;Replicas;Agility;Elasticity;Cloud-native applications","Measurement;Cloud computing;Error analysis;Quality of service;Containers;Predictive models;Logic gates","","","","22","IEEE","16 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed method, termed Service Affinity Graph-based Approach, employs a graph-based model to model the interactions among microservices. It formulates the service placement as a minimum-weight k-cut problem and utilizes an approximation algorithm for service clustering. This approach is realized through a conceptual framework that takes into account a wide range of optimization objectives, ranging from enhancing application performance and enforcing data privacy to optimizing operational costs. In addition to presenting the SAGA framework in details, this paper conducts an in-depth empirical evaluation using a prototype deployed on a Kubernetes cluster.

Each microservice is seamlessly exposed to users via AWS API Gateway, facilitating efficient interactions with their respective resources. AWS Lambda functions underpin the business logic for each microservice, enabling serverless execution and scalability, while interfacing with DynamoDB tables to ensure fast and reliable data storage. Notably, the Basket microservice triggers a checkout event, which is processed by the AWS EventBridge event bus. This eventdriven approach leverages multiple EventBridge rules to manage complex workflows and ensure timely responses to various application events. The Ordering microservice further enhances the system’s efficiency by employing an AWS SQS queue for asynchronous order processing, thereby decoupling the order submission and processing stages for improved reliability and performance. The entire infrastructure is meticulously orchestrated with AWS CDK CloudFormation, providing a framework for scalable, consistent, and automated deployments. Comprehensive monitoring and logging are facilitated by Amazon CloudWatch, offering real-time insights and operational oversight to maintain the health and performance of the application. This architecture not only supports scalability and flexibility but also ensures a seamless and responsive user experience.","2473-7674","979-8-3503-7024-9","10.1109/ICCCNT61001.2024.10726037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10726037","Product microservice;Basket microservice;Ordering microservice;EventBridge;AWS;CDK","Scalability;Microservice architectures;Memory;Computer architecture;Logic gates;User experience;Real-time systems;Reliability;Logic;Monitoring","","","","15","IEEE","4 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Identifying Operational Points for Deterministic Execution in Cloud Computing","S. Kambhatla; B. Bian; A.

Especially in such architectures that feature interacting microservices, performance degradation from a subset of resource-starved microservices could rapidly spread to other microservices creating additional performance hotspots and increasing tail latencies in inter-microservice communication - directly impacting deterministic execution of the overall cloud application. Optimizing resource allocation is one way to address this problem, and it has received some research attention. Specifically, two categories of approaches have been explored: a) correction after detection of performance bottlenecks, and b) predictive identification and correction of upcoming bottlenecks. This paper focuses on CPU support for deterministic cloud computing for either of these approaches, and also on identification of better operational points upfront. It highlights the benefits of using CPU hardware-based approaches through real-world benchmarks and explores an active learning approach to identify operational points enabling static and semi-static pre-configuration of resources. We present measurements from industry benchmark applications to demonstrate benefits of this CPU-based approach and illustrate effectiveness of our proposed preconfiguration method through a simulator featuring configurable number of microservices and inter-connectivity.","","978-1-7281-8266-7","10.1109/IEEECloudSummit48914.2020.00012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9283675","Cloud computing;microservices;determinism;Resource Director Technology;RDT;Intel® Xeon®","Industries;Degradation;Cloud computing;Scalability;Computer architecture;Benchmark testing;Resource management","","","","17","IEEE","15 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a consequence, digital services such as eHealth, remote education, or smart agriculture cannot be offered to the rural population. In this context, research on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) networks has emerged, which aims to solve the coverage problem by relying on small cells mounted on UAVs to provide coverage. From the network Quality of Service (QoS) point of view, i.e., the performance offered to users according to certain parameters such as delay, reliability, and throughput provisioning can be identified as one of the weak points. For the problem of maximizing throughput, the main solution is to group several UAVs in the same area. However, as the offered throughput increases, the power consumption will also increase. In this context, this paper proposes a genetic algorithm to solve the problem of jointly maximizing the offered throughput in rural scenarios where users request microservice-based IoT applications while minimizing the energy consumption of the swarm of UAVs. The algorithm is defined and evaluated in realistic scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness on increasing the throughput while decreasing the number of UAVs that are required.","2642-7389","979-8-3503-5423-2","10.1109/ISCC61673.2024.10733667","Ministry of Economy; Austrian Science Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10733667","UAV;Throughput;Energy efficiency;Genetic algorithm;Rural areas;MSA","Smart agriculture;Energy consumption;Microservice architectures;Quality of service;Throughput;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Telecommunications;Telecommunication network reliability;Investment;Genetic algorithms","","","","31","IEEE","31 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So far, VMs schedulers mostly implement all-or-nothing oversubscription strategies, wherein all VM resources are either oversubscribed or remain unaltered. While the former strategy offers higher consolidation rates, the latter delivers better performance guarantees.In this paper, we conducted an empirical study of the individual usage of virtual CPUs (vCPUs) in the OVHCloud production environment and we demonstrate that, as they are not uniformly utilized, the current holistic approach may not be appropriate. Based on these observations, we introduce a novel approach, named SweetspotVM, where oversubscription ratios are applied at the granularity of individual vCPU, instead of the whole VMs. This novel paradigm unlocks a more flexible oversubscription management strategy, pinning oversubscription ratios per vCPU within VMs. We present a prototype of SweetspotVM to illustrate the feasibility of accommodating multiple oversubscription levels within a single host and assigning them to individual vCPU.We assess the viability of our approach on a physical platform, demonstrating the possibility of dividing the cost of hosting VMs by 3, while maintaining the VMs performance at the level of non-oversubscribed platforms. We, therefore, believe that SweetspotVM opens new avenues to boost the consolidation of VMs on a reduced number of servers, with positive impacts on the environmental footprint of cloud computing.","2993-2114","979-8-3503-9566-2","10.1109/CCGrid59990.2024.00026","Agence Nationale de la Recherche; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10701371","Cloud;Oversubscription;IaaS","Industries;Cloud computing;Costs;Customer services;Prototypes;Production;Software;Servers;Resource management;Tuning","","","","29","IEEE","8 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present an experience report on the migration of a monolithic web application and use performance, availability and energy efficiency as quality attributes to shed light on such an architectural transition. Horizontal scaling, i.e., distributing the workload across several service instances, is applied and we study its impact.Our main findings are: i) when no app component is replicated, MSA outperforms the monolithic architecture; ii) the monolithic architecture shows performance and availability improvement when replicating the entire app; iii) the replicated MSA version reaches a ceiling when not replicating its routing part (i.e., the API gateway), showing worse response times compared to the replicated monolith; iv) when replicating the API gateway, the MSA version reaches optimal performance with fewer replicates than the monolith; v) when not replicating services, MSA consumes more CPU resources than the monolithic architecture; vi) when scaling up, the MSA version is more efficient than the replicated monolith in terms of memory usage, and it can better exploit CPU resources; vii) when not replicating services, MSA consumes more energy than the monolithic architecture, whereas when scaling up, the MSA version is more efficient than the replicated monolith; MSA version reaches a good balance between CPU and memory usage.","2836-3868","979-8-3503-6855-0","10.1109/ICWS62655.2024.00112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10707516","Microservices;architecture migration;horizontal scaling;load tests;performance;availability;energy usage","Energy consumption;Web services;Memory management;Microservice architectures;Software quality;Logic gates;Routing;Energy efficiency;Time factors;Testing","","","","42","IEEE","15 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Container orchestration platforms can help counteract this trend by optimally placing applications across the infrastructure to increase resource utilization and reduce energy consumption. But platforms in use today are still energy-agnostic and do not offer any insights into energy consumption. In this paper, we present a monitoring framework and a new modeling approach for resource usage in data centers. The model captures heterogeneous hardware and software and acts as input for a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to predict power consumption. Based on this model, we derive a set of container scheduling algorithms that opportunistically schedule applications based on the estimated energy impact of incoming containers. Our results show that the GNN-based prediction model is very accurate and achieves an average RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of 7.5%. We have implemented a custom scheduler to demonstrate the benefits of using our prediction, and our scheduler can decrease energy consumption on average by 6.2% without any code changes for the application and without increasing workload completion time compared to the default Kubernetes scheduler.","2993-2114","979-8-3503-9566-2","10.1109/CCGrid59990.2024.00042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10701405","GNN;Energy estimation;energy-aware scheduler","Energy consumption;Data centers;Schedules;Power demand;Scheduling algorithms;Containers;Predictive models;Graph neural networks;Data models;Software","","","","43","IEEE","8 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, because the applicable functional services are composed of small modules, the connectivity between the functions is poor. When processing a large amount of reading information, the response time of reading services is increased, so that the reader's borrowing operation time is prolonged.
