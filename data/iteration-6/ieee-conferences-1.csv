The growing demand for computationally expensive, state-of-the-art DNNs, coupled with diminishing performance gains of general-purpose architectures, has fueled an explosion of specialized Neural Processing Units (NPUs). NPUs for interactive services should satisfy two requirements: (1) execution of DNN models with low latency, high throughput, and high efficiency, and (2) flexibility to accommodate evolving state-of-the-art models (e.g., RNNs, CNNs, MLPs) without costly silicon updates. This paper describes the NPU architecture for Project Brainwave, a production-scale system for real-time AI. The Brainwave NPU achieves more than an order of magnitude improvement in latency and throughput over state-of-the-art GPUs on large RNNs at a batch size of 1. The NPU attains this performance using a single-threaded SIMD ISA paired with a distributed microarchitecture capable of dispatching over 7M operations from a single instruction. The spatially distributed microarchitecture, scaled up to 96,000 multiply-accumulate units, is supported by hierarchical instruction decoders and schedulers coupled with thousands of independently addressable high-bandwidth on-chip memories, and can transparently exploit many levels of fine-grain SIMD parallelism. When targeting an FPGA, microarchitectural parameters such as native datapaths and numerical precision can be ""synthesis specialized"" to models at compile time, enabling atypically high FPGA performance competitive with hardened NPUs. When running on an Intel Stratix 10 280 FPGA, the Brainwave NPU achieves performance ranging from ten to over thirty-five teraflops, with no batching, on large, memory-intensive RNNs.","2575-713X","978-1-5386-5984-7","10.1109/ISCA.2018.00012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8416814","neural network hardware;accelerator architectures;field programmable gate arrays","Field programmable gate arrays;Computer architecture;Throughput;Parallel processing;Real-time systems;Microarchitecture;Computational modeling","","361","2","60","IEEE","23 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The dynamically changing IoT environment requires these systems to be able to scale and evolve over time adopting new technologies and requirements. In response to the similar challenges in building large-scale distributed applications and platforms on the Web, micro service architecture style has emerged and gained a lot of popularity in the industry in recent years. In this work, we share our early experience of applying the micro service architecture style to design a Smart City IoT platform.

However, most of the existing control policies consider horizontal and vertical scaling as two disjointed control knobs. In this paper, we propose Reinforcement Learning (RL) solutions for controlling the horizontal and vertical elasticity of container-based applications with the goal to increase the flexibility to cope with varying workloads. Although RL represents an interesting approach, it may suffer from a possible long learning phase, especially when nothing about the system is known a-priori. To speed up the learning process and identify better adaptation policies, we propose RL solutions that exploit different degrees of knowledge about the system dynamics (i.e., Q-learning, Dyna-Q, and Model-based). We integrate the proposed policies in Elastic Docker Swarm, our extension that introduces self-adaptation capabilities in the container orchestration tool Docker Swarm.

Nevertheless, providing a proper resource scheduling for delay-sensitive and data-intensive services in Fog Computing environments is still a key research domain. Therefore, in this paper, a network-aware scheduling approach for container-based applications in Smart City deployments is proposed. Our proposal has been validated on the Kubernetes platform, an open source orchestrator for the automatic management and deployment of micro-services. Our approach has been implemented as an extension to the default scheduling mechanism available in Kubernetes, enabling Kubernetes to make resource provisioning decisions based on the current status of the network infrastructure. Evaluations based on Smart City container-based applications have been carried out to compare the performance of the proposed scheduling approach with the standard scheduling feature available in Kubernetes. Results show that the proposed approach achieves reductions of 80% in terms of network latency when compared to the default scheduling mechanism.","","978-1-5386-9376-6","10.1109/NETSOFT.2019.8806671","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8806671","Smart Cities;IoT;Fog Computing;Resource Provisioning;Kubernetes","Internet of Things;Containers;Smart cities;Servers;Scheduling;Edge computing;Processor scheduling","","95","","22","IEEE","22 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, effective online resource allocation decisions are hard to achieve due to dynamic workloads and the complicated interactions of microservices in each workflow. In this paper, we propose an adaptive resource allocation approach for microservice workflow system based on recent advances in reinforcement learning. Our approach (1) assumes little prior knowledge of the microservice workflow system and does not require any elaborately designed model or crafted representative simulator of the underlying system, and (2) avoids high sample complexity which is a common drawback of model-free reinforcement learning when applied to real-world scenarios.

Cloud infrastructure and accelerators that offer INFerence-as-a-Service (INFaaS) have become the enabler of this rather quick and invasive shift in the industry. To that end, mostly accelerator-based INFaaS (Google's TPU [1], NVIDIA T4 [2], Microsoft Brainwave [3], etc.) has become the backbone of many real-life applications. However, as the demand for such services grows, merely scaling-out the number of accelerators is not economically cost-effective. Although multi-tenancy has propelled datacenter scalability, it has not been a primary factor in designing DNN accelerators due to the arms race for higher speed and efficiency. This paper sets out to explore this timely requirement of multi-tenancy through a new dimension: dynamic architecture fission. To that end, we define Planaria1 that can dynamically fission (break) into multiple smaller yet full-fledged DNN engines at runtime. This microarchitectural capability enables spatially co-locating multiple DNN inference services on the same hardware, offering simultaneous multi-tenant DNN acceleration. To realize this dynamic reconfigurability, we first devise breakable omni-directional systolic arrays for DNN acceleration that allows omni-directional flow of data. Second, it uses this capability and a unique organization of on-chip memory, interconnection, and compute resources to enable fission in systolic array based DNN accelerators. Architecture fission and its associated flexibility enables an extra degree of freedom for task scheduling, that even allows breaking the accelerator with regard to the server load, DNN topology, and task priority. As such, it can simultaneously co-locate DNNs to enhance utilization, throughput, QoS, and fairness. We compare the proposed design to PREMA [4], a recent effort that offers multi-tenancy by time-multiplexing the DNN accelerator across multiple tasks. We use the same frequency, the same amount of compute and memory resources for both accelerators. The results show significant benefits with (soft, medium, hard) QoS requirements, in throughput (7.4×, 7.2×, 12.2×), SLA satisfaction rate (45%, 15%, 16%), and fairness (2.1×, 2.3×, 1.9×).","","978-1-7281-7383-2","10.1109/MICRO50266.2020.00062","Google; Qualcomm; Microsoft; Xilinx; National Science Foundation; Air Force Office of Scientific Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9251939","Accelerators;Deep Neural Networks;DNN;DNN Acceleration;Multi-Tenancy;Spatial DNN Task Co-Location;Multi-Tenant DNN Acceleration;Dynamic Architecture Fission;Omni-Directional Systolic Arrays","Industries;Microarchitecture;Computer architecture;Quality of service;Throughput;Acceleration;Task analysis","","49","","124","IEEE","11 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This results in sub-optimal, costly and error-prone deployments due to numerous unexpected overheads not initially envisioned in the design phase and underwhelming testing conditions not resembling the end environment. In this paper, we introduce Fogify, an emulator easing the modeling, deployment and large-scale experimentation of fog and edge testbeds. Fogify provides a toolset to: (i) model complex fog topologies comprised of heterogeneous resources, network capabilities and QoS criteria; (ii) deploy the modelled configuration and services using popular containerized descriptions to a cloud or local environment; (iii) experiment, measure and evaluate the deployment by injecting faults and adapting the configuration at runtime to test different “what-if” scenarios that reveal the limitations of a service before introduced to the public. In the evaluation, proof-of-concept IoT services with real-world workloads are introduced to show the wide applicability and benefits of rapid prototyping via Fogify.","","978-1-7281-5943-0","10.1109/SEC50012.2020.00011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9355701","Fog Computing;Internet of Things","Runtime;Network topology;Emulation;Rapid prototyping;Topology;Internet of Things;Edge computing","","43","","43","IEEE","22 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By breaking a monolithic application into loosely coupled microservices, great gain can be achieved in performance, flexibility and robustness. In this paper, we study the important problem of load balancing across IoT microservice instances. A key difficulty in this problem is the interdependencies among microservices: the load on a successor microservice instance directly depends on the load distributed from its predecessor microservice instances. We propose a graph-based model for describing the load dependencies among microservices. Based on the model, we first propose a basic formulation for load balancing, which can be solved optimally in polynomial time. The basic model neglects the quality-of-service (QoS) of the IoT application. We then propose a QoS-aware load balancing model, based on a novel abstraction that captures a realization of the application's internal logic. The QoS-aware load balancing problem is NP-hard. We propose a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the QoS-aware problem. We show through simulation experiments that our proposed algorithm achieves enhanced QoS compared to heuristic solutions.","2641-9874","978-1-7281-0515-4","10.1109/INFOCOM.2019.8737450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8737450","IoT;microservice;application graph;load balancing;fully polynomial-time approximation scheme","Load management;Quality of service;Load modeling;Internet of Things;Delays;Computational modeling;Cloud computing","","40","","33","IEEE","17 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Incidentally, data centres become over-encumbered during peak usage hours and underutilized during off-peak hours. Traditional microservice scaling methods perform either horizontal or vertical scaling exclusively. When used in combination, however, these methods offer complementary benefits and compensate for each other's deficiencies. To leverage the high availability of horizontal scaling and the fine-grained resource control of vertical scaling, we developed two novel hybrid autoscaling algorithms and a dedicated network scaling algorithm and benchmarked them against Google's popular Kubernetes horizontal autoscaling algorithm.

However, emerging techniques often result in the violation of Quality-of-Service (QoS) of microservice-based services in cloud-edge continuum, as they do not consider the communication overhead or the resource contention between microservices.We propose Nautilus, a runtime system that effectively deploys microservice-based user-facing services in cloud-edge continuum. It ensures the QoS of microservice-based user-facing services while minimizing the required computational resources. Nautilus is comprised of a communication-aware microservice mapper, a contention-aware resource manager and a load-aware microservice scheduler. The mapper divides the microservice graph into multiple partitions based on the communication overhead and maps the partitions to the nodes. On each node, the resource manager determines the optimal resource allocation for its microservices based on reinforcement learning that may capture the complex contention behaviors. The microservice scheduler monitors the QoS of the entire service, and migrates microservices from busy nodes to idle ones at runtime. Our experimental results show that Nautilus reduces the computational resource usage by 23.9% and the network bandwidth usage by 53.4%, while achieving the required 99%-ile latency.","1530-2075","978-1-6654-4066-0","10.1109/IPDPS49936.2021.00102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9460542","","Distributed processing;Runtime;Quality of service;Computer architecture;Reinforcement learning;Bandwidth;Resource management","","33","","38","IEEE","28 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this deployment leads to problems such as bottleneck-shifting and increased oscillations. Existing auto-scalers that scale applications consisting of multiple services are kept closed-source. To face these challenges, we first survey existing auto-scalers and highlight current challenges. Then, we introduce Chamulteon, a redesign of our previously introduced mechanism, which can scale applications consisting of multiple services in a coordinated manner.

This auto-scaling service, however, requires a seemingly difficult parameter set to be customized by the application provider, and those management parameters are static while incoming web request dynamics often change, not to mention the fact that scaling decisions are inherently reactive, instead of being proactive. Therefore we set the ultimate goal of making cloud-based web applications' management easier and more effective. We propose a Kubernetes scaling engine that makes the auto-scaling decisions apt for handling the actual variability of incoming requests. In this engine various AI-based forecast methods compete with each other via a short-term evaluation loop in order to always give the lead to the method that suits best the actual request dynamics, as soon as possible. We also introduce a compact management parameter for the cloud-tenant application provider in order to easily set their sweet spot in the resource over-provisioning vs. SLA violation trade-off. The multi-forecast scaling engine and the proposed management parameter are evaluated both in simulations and with measurements on our collected web traces to show the improved quality of fitting provisioned resources to service demand. We find that with just a few competing forecast methods, our auto-scaling engine, implemented in Kubernetes, results in significantly less lost requests with slightly more provisioned resources compared to the default baseline.","","978-1-7281-6095-5","10.1109/CCGrid49817.2020.00-33","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9139654","cloud computing;artificial intelligence;auto-scaling;Kubernetes;forecast;resource management","Cloud computing;Containers;Adaptation models;Servers;Engines;Measurement;Resource management","","32","","30","IEEE","14 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The idea is to postpone the wake up of a CPU as long as possible and then adjust the frequency so that the tail latency constraint of requests are satisfied just-in-time. μDPM reduces processor energy consumption by up to 32% and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by 2×.","2378-203X","978-1-7281-1444-6","10.1109/HPCA.2019.00032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8675218","Dynamic power management;DVFS;Sleep states","Power system management;Servers;Energy consumption;Power demand;Data centers;Market research;Linux","","30","","57","IEEE","28 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They are complex systems-of-systems, with many interacting elements, that consume vast amounts of power. Demand for such facilities is growing rapidly, leading to significant global environmental impact. The data center industry has conducted much research into efficiency improvements, but this has mostly been at the physical infrastructure level. Research into software-based solutions for improving efficiency is greatly needed. However, most current research does not take a holistic view of the data center that considers virtual and physical infrastructures as well as business process. This is crucial if a solution is to be applied in a realistic setting. This paper describes the complex, system-of-systems nature of data centers, and discusses the service models used in the industry. We describe a holistic scheduling system that replaces the default scheduler in the Kubernetes container system, taking into account both software and hardware models. We discuss the initial results of deploying this scheme in a real data center, where power consumption reductions of 10-20% were observed. We show that by introducing hardware modelling into a software-based solution, an intelligent scheduler can make significant improvements in data center efficiency. We conclude by looking at some of the future work that needs to be performed in this area.","2642-6587","978-1-7281-1442-2","10.1109/SOSE.2019.00030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8705815","kubernetes;docker;containers;energy;power;efficiency;data center;scheduling;behavior;modeling;analytics;holistic;pue;interference","Data centers;Servers;Software;Industries;Cooling;Hardware;Data models","","27","2","19","IEEE","6 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve this, ANT-Man abstracts away two major sources of latency overhead in traditional hierarchical power management frameworks. First, ANT-Man proposes an auto power budgeting scheme for reducing the power coordination latency at the datacenter level. It can proactively determine the power budget tailored to each individual microservice. Second, ANT-Man proposes a native and transparent power control scheme to overcome the power configuration latency for each microservice. It enables super-fast power budget enforcement with nanosecond-scale performance scaling.

"Adversarial Machine Learning for Flooding Attacks on 5G Radio Access Network Slicing","Y. Shi; Y. E.

Each communication request comes with quality of experience (QoE) requirements such as throughput and latency/deadline, which can be met by assigning RBs, communication power, and processing power to the request. For a completed request, the achieved reward can be measured by the weight (priority) of this request. The accumulated reward over time should be maximized by allocating resources, e.g., with reinforcement learning. In this paper, we introduce a novel flooding attack on 5G network slicing, where an adversary generates fake network slicing requests to consume the 5G RAN resources that would be otherwise available to real requests. The adversary observes the spectrum and builds a request generation algorithm through reinforcement learning that decides on how to craft fake requests to maximize the reward of fake requests over time, which in turn minimizes the reward of real requests over time. We show that the portion of the reward achieved by real requests may be much less than the reward that would be achieved when there was no attack. We also show that this flooding attack is more effective than other benchmark attacks such as generating random fake requests and fake requests with the minimum resource requirement (lowest QoE requirement). Finally, we evaluate how the attack performance depends on system parameters such as the weight and the generation rate of fake requests, and the channel condition. Our results show that the flooding attack poses a major threat for network slicing in terms of starving 5G RAN resources and denying service to real network slicing requests.","2694-2941","978-1-7281-9441-7","10.1109/ICCWorkshops50388.2021.9473567","U.S. Army; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473567","","Weight measurement;5G mobile communication;Network slicing;Conferences;Reinforcement learning;Throughput;Quality of experience","","25","","43","IEEE","9 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Energy awareness is critical since edge nodes, in many Internet of Things (IoT) domains, are meant to be powered by renewable energy sources that are variable, making low-powered and/or overloaded (bottleneck) nodes unavailable and not operating their services. This awareness is also required since energy challenges have not been previously addressed by Serverless, largely due to its origin in cloud computing. To achieve this, we formally model an energy-aware resource scheduling problem in Serverless edge computing, given a cluster of battery-operated and renewable-energy powered nodes. Then, we devise zone-oriented and priority-based algorithms to improve the operational availability of bottleneck nodes. As assets, our algorithm coins terms “sticky offloading” and “warm scheduling” in the interest of the Quality of Service (QoS). We evaluate our proposal against well-known benchmarks using real-world implementations on a cluster of Raspberry Pis enabled with container orchestration, Kubernetes, and Serverless computing, OpenFaaS, where edge nodes are powered by real-world solar irradiation. Experimental results achieve significant improvements, up to 33%, in helping bottleneck node's operational availability while preserving the QoS.

To this end, we propose in this paper a framework for resource orchestration for 5G network slices implementing four Quality of Service pillars. Starting from traffic classification, demands are marked so that they are best served by dedicated logical virtual networks called Network Slices (NSs). To optimally serve multiple NSs over the same physical network, we then implement a new dynamic slicing approach of network resources exploiting Machine Learning (ML). Indeed, as demands change dynamically, a mere recursive optimization leading to progressive convergence towards an optimum slice is not sufficient. Consequently, we need an initial well-informed slicing decision of physical resources from a total available resource pool. Moreover, we formalize both admission control and slice scheduler modules as Knapsack problems. Using our 5G experimental prototype based on OpenAirInterface (OAI), we generate a realistic dataset for evaluating ML based approaches as well as two baselines solutions (i.e. static slicing and uninformed random slicing-decisions). Simulation results show that using regression trees as an ML based approach for both classification and prediction, outperform other alternative solutions in terms of prediction accuracy and throughput.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-0962-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9013129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9013129","","5G mobile communication;Quality of service;Resource management;Throughput;Prediction algorithms;Machine learning;Prototypes","","24","","22","IEEE","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We observe that datacenter schedulers are agnostic of these emerging accelerators, especially their resource utilization footprints, and thus, not well equipped to dynamically provision them based on the application needs. We observe that the state-of-the-art datacenter schedulers fail to provide fine-grained resource guarantees for latency-sensitive tasks that are GPU-bound. Specifically for GPUs, this results in resource fragmentation and interference leading to poor utilization of allocated GPU resources. Furthermore, GPUs exhibit highly linear energy efficiency with respect to utilization and hence proactive management of these resources is essential to keep the operational costs low while ensuring the end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) in case of user-facing queries.Towards addressing the GPU orchestration problem, we build Knots, a GPU-aware resource orchestration layer and integrate it with the Kubernetes container orchestrator to build Kube- Knots. Kube-Knots can dynamically harvest spare compute cycles through dynamic container orchestration enabling co-location of latency-critical and batch workloads together while improving the overall resource utilization. We design and evaluate two GPU-based scheduling techniques to schedule datacenter-scale workloads through Kube-Knots on a ten node GPU cluster. Our proposed Correlation Based Prediction (CBP) and Peak Prediction (PP) schemes together improves both average and 99th percentile cluster-wide GPU utilization by up to 80% in case of HPC workloads. In addition, CBP+PP improves the average job completion times (JCT) of deep learning workloads by up to 36% when compared to state-of-the-art schedulers. This leads to 33% cluster-wide energy savings on an average for three different workloads compared to state-of-the-art GPU-agnostic schedulers. Further, the proposed PP scheduler guarantees the end-to-end QoS for latency-critical queries by reducing QoS violations by up to 53% when compared to state-of-the-art GPU schedulers.","2168-9253","978-1-7281-4734-5","10.1109/CLUSTER.2019.8891040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8891040","","Graphics processing units;Containers;Measurement;Task analysis;Quality of service;Resource management;Correlation","","24","","64","IEEE","7 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, most of the current approaches are not fully sensitive to the edge properties and also lack adequate support for Service Level Objective (SLO) awareness. Previously, we introduced software defined gateways (SDGs), which enable managing novel edge resources at scale. At the same time Kubernetes was initially released. In spite of not being specifically developed for the edge, Kubernetes implements many of the design principles introduced by our SDGs, making it suitable for building SDG extensions on top of it.

The typical resultant approach is a cloud-centered architecture providing an analytic service for real-time IoT data processing. However, a cloud-centered IoT analytic service cannot guarantee real-time responsiveness has a high-fee pay-as-you-go business model, and opens data privacy concerns. Hence, it becomes rational to shift analytic workloads to the edge and provide a management service for edge analysis. Existing work on providing edge analytics as a service encountered challenges such as lacking a lightweight way to compose IoT applications based on multiple service providers, lacking a flexible and unified way to define domain-specific analytic logic, and maintaining efficiency when processing data on a resource-limited edge. This paper presents EAaaS, a scalable analytic service for enabling real-time edge analytics in IoT scenarios. In this work, we propose a unified rule-based analytic model to ease user's programming efforts in specifying rule-based analytic logic. Moreover, we also designed and implemented a high performance edge engine to apply rule-based analytic on incoming device data streams. To simplify the access to EAaaS service, a group of RESTful web interfaces is also designed for edge analytic management on cloud and flexible composition with external services. EAaaS is implemented as a part of IBM Watson IoT Platform, which is a cloud service for elementary IoT application development on IBM Bluemix cloud announced by IBM recently. We have conducted proof of correctness (PoC) of EAaaS with customers from boat racing in the U.S. and collected valuable feedback from customers for further enhancement of EAaaS's flexibility and usability.","","978-1-5386-0752-7","10.1109/ICWS.2017.130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8029781","Internet of Things; Real-time event processing; Rule-based edge analytic","Logic gates;Analytical models;Data models;Real-time systems;Cloud computing;Monitoring;Edge computing","","22","","13","IEEE","11 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The purpose of this paper is to showcase how to build an efficient Internet of Things (IoT) application for aquaponics in order to create an autonomous, self-regulating system with the help of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). An open standard of WSN called 6LoWPAN is being used in this system which helps us to construct a global infrastructure. The designed aquaponic system is composed of sensor devices that can sense and collect information of the various dimensions of the water quality involved and store it in a cloud database. This means that the human intervention would be considerably less when compared to the traditional methods of aquaponics. In addition to the traditional technique, with the help of Next-Gen Telco technologies, i.e., using their high bandwidth and low latency, infected fishes are detected automatically on time and treat them to ensure the balance in our aquaponics ecosystem.

This data needs to be stored efficiently so that it can be efficiently retrieved on demand for real-time application. Most of the Cloud-IoT solutions focus on centralized data collection and storage which is not appropriate for efficient data collection and utilization. For addressing such diverse set of requirements,resources are placed near to the data sources for processing and fast real-time decision making instead of sending all the data to the Cloud. The gateway is such a type of edge device that collects data from smart sensors, but it does not have any pre-processing or decision-making capabilities. Therefore, the gateway has to be made smarter with Fog capabilities and named as Fog Smart Gateway(FSG). We represent the distributed Cloud-IoT solution where data optimally distributed among mini-clouds/Fog nodes. The processing of IoT traffic is taken care of by Virtual Machines(VMs) facilitated by distributed mini-clouds/Fog nodes and located within the edge devices. We optimized the number of mini-clouds placement to reduce the total latency and power consumption induced by traffic aggregation and processing. However, there has been little research on fog node placement. Our results show that the optimal distribution of mini-clouds in the IoT network could yield a total energy saving and reduction in latency compared to processing IoT data in a conventional cloud system.","","978-1-5386-2924-6","10.1109/ICIT.2017.40","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8423891","Fog computing;Fog node;IoT;Edge devices;Service latency;Energy consumption","Cloud computing;Logic gates;Edge computing;Real-time systems;Data collection;Data centers;Internet of Things","","19","","19","IEEE","2 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To combat such scenarios, new paradigm Edge Computing is used. Edge computing shifts the computation of resources from centralized cloud closer to the devices which generates data. Edge Computing reduces the response time, latency and improves the battery life while maintaining data safety and privacy. The distributed architecture of edge computing makes resource management an important aspect of edge computing. In such a resource constrained environment edge devices should be capable of processing all types of request coming from IoT devices. With the advancement in Data science and Machine learning models in different domains, many intelligent services have emerged to provide better user experience. These deep learning models have frequent updates to adapt to new hardware and software requirements. These models also have some installation dependencies and requirement of cross platform compatibility for training and prediction. In home edge environment, these issues are more important due to resource constraint in terms of memory and computing power. Also, due to the availability of extensive list of deep learning models for different service, it is difficult to maintain an environment supporting such models across various devices in the smart home to support all services. To solve this issue in smart home environment, this paper proposes architecture, using containerization techniques to deploy and manage the deep learning models. This paper also explains about the steps to convert the existing model into containers. Minimal space requirement on the edge device, data privacy, low latency along with device independence for deep learning models are prime benefits of the architecture proposed. To test the performance of the architecture, deep learning model was containerized and compared with the actual model deployed in the same edge environment. The experimental results demonstrated the performance is almost similar of the containerized architecture in terms of model execution time and CPU load vs execution time. But it comes with ease of model deployment and cross platform model execution.","2329-7190","978-1-7281-4514-3","10.1109/ICCCI48352.2020.9104073","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9104073","Containers;Deep Learning Model;Edge computing;Dockers;Micro service;Distributed Computing;Smart Home","Deep learning;Performance evaluation;Adaptation models;Data privacy;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Smart homes","","17","","33","IEEE","1 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our runtime continuously monitors the interaction among the microservices, estimates the data produced and exchanged among the microservices, and uses a novel graph min-cut algorithm to dynamically map the microservices to the edge or the cloud to satisfy application-specific response times. Our runtime also handles temporary network partitions, and maintains data consistency across the distributed fabric by using microservice proxies to reduce WAN bandwidth by an order of magnitude, all in an application-specific manner by leveraging knowledge about the application's functions, latency-critical pipelines and intermediate data.

This challenge can be overcome with containerization, a form of lightweight virtualization, bringing support for a wide range of hardware architectures and operating system agnostic deployment of applications on IoT gateways. This paper discusses the architectural aspects of containerization, and studies the suitability of available containerization tools for multi-container deployment in the context of IoT gateways. We present containerization in the context of AGILE, a multi-container and micro-service based open source framework for IoT gateways, developed as part of a Horizon 2020 project.

For tackling the challenge posed by uncertainty in delivering more reliable systems, this paper proposes a novel online Model-based Testing technique that complements classic test case generation based on pseudo-random sampling strategies with an uncertainty-aware sampling strategy. To deal with system uncertainty during testing, the proposed strategy builds on an Inverse Uncertainty Quantification approach that is related to the discrepancy between the measured data at run-time (while the system executes) and a Markov Decision Process model describing the behavior of the system under test. To this purpose, a conformance game approach is adopted in which tests feed a Bayesian inference calibrator that continuously learns from test data to tune the system model and the system itself. A comparative evaluation between the proposed uncertainty-aware sampling policy and classical pseudo-random sampling policies is also presented using the Tele Assistance System running example, showing the differences in achieved accuracy and efficiency.","2332-6549","978-1-5386-8321-7","10.1109/ISSRE.2018.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8539067","Uncertainty quantification;Reliability under Uncertainty;Bayesian Calibration;Online Model-based Testing","Uncertainty;Bayes methods;Probabilistic logic;Testing;Markov processes;Software reliability","","14","","35","IEEE","18 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, various studies advocate that the existing DCs are often underutilized. To be precise, almost 30% of the installed DCs in the United States are comatose. In addition to this, the existing DC architecture leads to extensive energy utilization, which severely hampers the environment and places a severe risk on the power sector. Thus, it is highly essential to reduce DC's energy utilization through efficient resource consolidation approaches. In this work, we investigate the joint impact of resource consolidation and load balancing on cutting down the energy utilization indices of the cloud DCs. In this vein, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) for container placement across heterogeneous infrastructure, primarily with the intent to minimize the overall energy consumption and balance the load amongst the operating hosts. However, due to the hardness of the underlying problem and its infeasibility to furnish optimal solutions in polynomial time, we designed an online solution based on the incremental exploration of the solution space to map containers on the available array of hosts such that the objectives mentioned above can be attained. Finally, we evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm in contrast to an existing algorithm on real-time workload traces obtained from PlanetLab.

The architecture adopts a Mobile Edge Computing based infrastructure that is suitable for 4G and 5G mobile cellular networks.

The internet of things is changing much about the world people live in from the way they drive to how they make purchases and even how they get energy for their homes and many more. On the other hand, incidents due to industrial hazard are common leading to loss of life, health or property. So an attempt is made to develop an intelligent system for industrial hazard monitoring using IoT which will be useful to the society by reducing the effects of hazard to a great extent. So keeping this in mind an IoT based hazard monitoring system is implemented using raspberry-pi as the gateway node which receives the data from a heterogeneous network to monitor the readings of different nodes. Sensor data is stored into a MySQL database using MQTT as the messaging protocol. Also focus is laid on periodically collecting the data which can be accessed by the end users using a dynamic web page with an option for graphical view of the data. Moreover, a notification system using AWS IoT platform is implemented for alert situations. Furthermore, interoperability among the end nodes is taken into account by proposing a method which will remove the dependency on a particular vendor along with its own data format.","","978-1-5386-2456-2","10.1109/ICIRCA.2018.8597430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8597430","IoT (Internet of Things);Industrial hazard;Raspberry pi;nRF24L01;XBee;Interoperability;MQTT;AWS IoT","Hazards;Protocols;Monitoring;Logic gates;Cloud computing;Interoperability;Internet of Things","","13","","18","IEEE","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current approaches favor hosting Machine Learning (ML) models on Linux-based single-board computers. Nevertheless, these devices’ cost and energy requirements limit the possible application scenarios. Conversely, today’s available 32-bit microcontrollers have much lower costs and only need a few milliwatts to operate, making them an energy-efficient and cost-effective alternative. However, the latter devices, usually referred to as far edge devices, have stringent resource constraints and host non-Linux-based embedded real-time operating systems. Therefore, orchestrating such devices executing portions of ML applications represents a major challenge with current tools and frameworks. This paper formally introduces the Tiny-MLOps framework as the specialization of standard ML orchestration practices, including far edge devices in the loop. To this aim, we will tailor each phase of the classical ML orchestration loop to the reduced resources available onboard typical IoT devices. We will rely on the proposed framework to deliver adaptation and evolving capabilities to resource-constrained IoT sensors mounted on an industrial rotary machine to detect anomalies. As a feasibility study, We will show how to programmatically re-deploy ML-based anomaly detection models to far edge devices. Our preliminary experiments measuring the system performance in terms of deployment, loading, and inference latency of the ML models will corroborate the usefulness of our proposal.","2473-4691","978-1-6654-3706-6","10.1109/EAIS51927.2022.9787703","Provincia Autonoma di Trento; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9787703","","Adaptation models;Costs;Image edge detection;System performance;Transforms;Real-time systems;Sensors","","13","","20","IEEE","6 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to deal with the problem, a container scheduling strategy based on machine learning is proposed in this paper. The paper uses the data set obtained by our experiments to train random forest regression model in advance to predict the required containers of services in the next time window, according to the current load pressure of services. Large amounts of data has been collected to make the data set for the experiment. Based on the data set, random forest regression model has been trained in advance to predict the number of required containers of services in next time window. When adjusting the number of containers to balance load pressure of services, the proposed algorithm saves 50% of the time compared with traditional algorithms.

Hardware accelerators, and in particular FPGAs, are a very promising solution for NFV, both for their high performance, predictability, programmability and reconfigurability. Recently, consolidation is brought to its limit in this field with lightweight virtualization techniques, which require a high overcommitment of FPGA accelerators resources in order to cope with the needs of thousands of guests. The lack of such virtualization support, together with cloud integration and programmability issues, limits the deployment of FPGAs in NFV. This paper presents the Virtualization Manager (VirtManager), an FPGA IP block which enables accelerators overcommitment with direct guest access. This is a key feature to enable the acceleration of thousands of guests, as it is the case for lightweight VMs, containers and unikernels. This paper's main contribution is a novel architecture for FPGA virtualization with support for resources overcommitment, NFV management and orchestration.

Aimed at overcoming this challenge, heterogeneous architectures have started to become part of the standard equipment used in data centers. Despite this effort, heterogeneous systems remain difficult to program and manage, while their effectiveness has been proven only in the HPC domain. Cloud workloads are different in nature and a way to exploit heterogeneity effectively is still lacking. This paper takes a first step towards an effective use of heterogeneous architectures in cloud infrastructures. It presents an in-depth analysis of cloud workloads, highlighting where energy efficiency can be obtained. The microservices paradigm is then presented as a way of intelligently partitioning applications in such a way that different components can take advantage of the heterogeneous hardware, thus providing energy efficiency.

The existing simple resource allocation algorithms, such as the round-robin policy used in many commercial server-less systems, suffer from lack of responsiveness to a sudden surge in the incoming workload. This will result in an unsatisfactory performance degradation that is directly experienced by the end-user of a Lambda application. In this paper, we address the problem of CPU cap management in a Lambda platform for ensuring different QoS enforcement levels in a platform with shared resources, in case of fluctuations and sudden surges in the incoming workload requests. To this end, we present a closed-loop (feedback-based) CPU cap controller, which fulfills the QoS levels enforced by the application owners. The controller adjusts the number of working threads per QoS class and dispatches the outstanding Lambda functions along with the associated events to the most appropriate working thread. The proposed solution reduces the QoS violations by an average of 6.36 times compared to the round-robin policy. It can also maintain the end-to-end response time of applications belonging to the highest priority QoS class close to the target set-point while decreasing the overall response time by up to 52%.","2168-9253","978-1-5386-8319-4","10.1109/CLUSTER.2018.00041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8514884","Server-less computing, FaaS (Function as a Service), QoS-aware resource manager, Dynamic CPU usage control","Quality of service;Instruction sets;Delays;Time factors;Surges;Resource management","","12","","27","IEEE","1 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different deployments of distributed software components on heterogeneous servers can lead to significant differences in power consumption, depending on the server allocation and the current workload. As workloads and load intensity change, components may be re-deployed or exchanged in order to reduce the power consumption for the current load profile. The decision on which component to place on which server during run-time remains difficult as the power consumption that would result from such a placement remains unknown. Existing work on component deployment optimization at run-time focuses on maximizing performance or considers power in the context of static design time decisions. In this paper, we introduce a model to predict the power consumption of component placements at run-time based on the load and power profile collected for a running distributed application in a heterogeneous environment. In addition, we present a model that enables the use of our approach without dedicated power measurement devices, predicting power consumption based on load intensity and performance counters.

Such containers are becoming increasingly popular in developer community as they facilitate fast development and delivery of enterprise class Cloud services. Furthermore, these containers share a common OS and hence, they have a low resource foot-print leading to reduced provisioning time. In this paper, we investigate such promise of containers while provisioning large scale 3-tier applications. First, through benchmarking, we observe that at very large scale, several application scaling factors (e.g., number of containers of an application provisioned in parallel, application load) and system state parameters (e.g., number of applications and containers running on a system) introduce variability in application provisioning time because of resource bottleneck in general, and specifically due to the OS process overhead. To address such variability, we propose a provisioning decision management system SCoPe that provides an application partitioning and provisioning strategy where we determine the maximum number of containers of every application that can be provisioned in parallel across physical machines, while meeting the service level agreement (SLA) on provisioning time and Cloud provider specific objectives (e.g., maximize consolidation of applications, minimize operating cost). This joint partitioning and provisioning problem is NP-hard and we propose a greedy heuristic solution. Using real data set and through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the performance of SCoPe for large scale container based application provisioning. Compared to other well-known heuristics, SCoPe can reduce the partitioning by 5x or more, while meeting SLAs.","2159-6190","978-1-5090-2619-7","10.1109/CLOUD.2016.0038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7820275","","Containers;Cloud computing;Benchmark testing;Aggregates;Engines;Virtualization;Google","","11","1","29","IEEE","19 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Much effort is spent to defining what a smart city is and how it could be realized with today's or future technologies. However, from requirements engineering perspective, our knowledge of smart cities is fragmented; little is known about the requirements for smart cities as complex systems, or as systems of systems, in specific application domains. In this paper, we elicit requirements for smart city systems by carrying out a systematic review of scientific literature focused on the so-called “hard” domains of smart cities. Based on 32 selected publications, we gathered and classified requirements in respect to three types of smart city systems (instrumented, interconnected, and intelligent systems) and four classes of requirements: end-to-end experience, architectural, security, and infrastructure requirements. Our most important findings are that: (1) most authors took a bottom-up approach to defining requirements for smart cities; their efforts focused mainly on requirements important for designing an architecture that could scale up to any size and include any device or system; and (2) very little is mentioned on the newly emerging security and privacy challenges that are critical to gain the citizens' acceptance of smart city apps.","2151-1357","978-1-5386-6517-6","10.1109/RCIS.2018.8406655","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8406655","Smart city systems;Requirements engineering;Software architecture;Systematic literature review;Empirical study","Smart cities;Instruments;Security;Intelligent systems;Data mining;Systematics","","11","","","IEEE","9 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Leveraging the edge computation resources effectively with energy-awareness, and dealing with intermittent failures of FANET links are the major challenges in supporting video processing applications. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-aware dynamic computation offloading scheme for UAV systems, which provides the ability to intelligently share tasks among individual UAVs and allows for parallel execution of tasks while evenly distributing energy consumption. Intelligence gathering is performed using machine learning to create resource consumption profiles for a given set of video processing tasks prior to scheduling. Our scheme handles the problem of computation offloading tasks as a job-shop scheduling problem where we aim to minimize the total energy consumption in the edge resources while minimizing video processing times to meet application requirements. Our experimental results show our energy-aware dynamic offloading scheme enables lower processing time for low drone-to-ground server ratios and consumes less energy when compared to other offloading schemes.

Thus, processing IoT data streams closer to the end-users and IoT domain can solve several operational challenges. Since then, a plethora of application-specific IoT systems are introduced, mainly hard-coded, inflexible, and limited extensibility for future changes. Additionally, most IoT systems maintain a centralized design to operate without considering the dynamic nature of edge networks. In this paper, we discuss some of the research issues, challenges, and potential solutions to enable: i) deploying edge functions on edge resources in a distributed manner and ii) deploying and scaling edge applications on-premises of Edge-Cloud infrastructure.

Therefore, modern assets usually include several embedded sensors and processing units, allowing to monitor certain operational parameters, i.e., Condition Monitoring. The sensed data can be later analyzed using Machine Learning (ML) approaches to detect anomalies and anticipate failures. Furthermore, the Internet of Things can provide the tools to extend Condition Monitoring to legacy assets that do not have onboard sensing capabilities. In general, these IoT devices offer the opportunity to move ML processing closer to the monitored asset, thus reducing costs and simplifying the anomaly detection system. However, extreme industrial environments present harsh operating conditions and limited resources, further exacerbated by the reduced computation capabilities of most IoT devices. This paper proposes an ML-based anomaly detection system that uses a retrofitting kit based on a constrained and cost-effective IoT device. Despite its limited resources, the latter executes a state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm locally, autonomously learning the normality behavior of the monitored asset.

As such, a cloud-native deployment can cover the end-to-end 5G network architecture, from the Core Network to the base stations, with the respective services benefiting from several advanced features, such as automatic scaling of the deployed functions based on monitored metrics. Through the application of Machine Learning, the evolution of the metrics can be predicted and thus the respective functions can be pro-actively scaled. In this work, we use an end-to-end real-world cloud-native deployment of a 5G network, and deal with two different types of scaling, applied at three different parts of the network: vertical scaling for the base station, and horizontal scaling for control and user plane functions of the core network. We use a real-world dataset for replicating traffic over our setup and closely monitor the evolution of metrics from different parts of the network.

We present a system architecture that integrates different sensors and analyzes and visualizes the power consumption of devices, machines, and production plants.

In this paper, we design Goldilocks, a novel resource provisioning system for optimizing both power and task completion time by allocating tasks to servers in groups. Tasks hosted in containers are grouped together by running a graph partitioning algorithm. Containers communicating frequently are placed together, which improves the task completion times.

Containers enabled the adaptation of the application capacity to the changing workload on the finer level of granularity than it was possible only with virtual machines. The common way to automate the adaptation of a cloud application is via autoscaling. Autoscaling is provided both on the level of virtual machines and containers. Its accuracy on dynamic workloads suffers significantly from the reactive nature of the available autoscaling solutions. The aim of the paper is to explore potential improvements of autoscaling by designing and evaluating several predictive-based autoscaling policies. These policies are naive (used as a baseline), best resource pair, only-Delta-load, always-resize, resize when beneficial. The scaling policies were implemented in Scaling Policy Derivation Tool (SPDT). SPDT takes the long-term forecast of the workload and the capacity model of microservices as input to produce the sequence of scaling actions scheduled for the execution in future with the aims to meet the service level objectives and minimize the costs. Policies implemented in SPDT were evaluated for three microservice applications and several workload patterns. The tests demonstrate that the combination of horizontal and vertical scaling enables more flexibility and reduces costs. Schedule derivation according to some policies might be compute-intensive, therefore careful consideration of the optimization objective (e.g. cost minimization or timeliness of the scaling policy) is required from the user of SPDT.","2474-0756","978-1-7281-2411-7","10.1109/ICAC.2019.00029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8831221","Cloud Computing, Containers, Microservices, Predictive Autoscaling, Scaling Policies, Self-Adaptive Cloud","Containers;Cloud computing;Virtualization;Random access memory;Virtual machining;Schedules;Tools","","10","","22","IEEE","12 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The IoT concept is nowadays intrinsic to traditional products and services. With its rapid development, more and more small smart devices are connected over the Internet in order to monitor, collect and exchange data in real-time to provide smart IoT-as-a-Services (IoTaaS). A few years ago, IoT devices exclusively sent data to a centralized Cloud data center; today it is possible to perform ""on board"" processing tasks at the Edge of the network and subsequently share or use the obtained results closer to users. This paper, focusing on a smart grid scenario, investigates the possibility of creating an IoTaaS for smart metering, including a microservice for IoT devices capable of acquiring and processing electrical data using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. In particular, we experimentally use the smart metering IoTaaS running on a Raspberry Pi 3 device to perform a harmonic analysis of a frequency signal of the domestic electrical grid in order to characterize the non-linear loads associated to the electronic devices (e.g., smart TV, computers, etc) with the purpose of monitoring their status and preventing possible malfunctions and faults.","","978-1-7281-2365-3","10.1109/CFEC.2019.8733148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8733148","Smart metering;smart grid;energy;power;FFT;Cloud Computing;Internet of Things;Edge Computing.","Cloud computing;Harmonic analysis;Internet of Things;Monitoring;Power quality;Fast Fourier transforms","","10","","15","IEEE","10 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite accelerating microservice diversity, there is a strong requirement to limit diversity in underlying server hardware to maintain hardware resource fungibility, preserve procurement economies of scale, and curb qualification/test overheads. As such, there is an urgent need for strategies that enable limited server CPU architectures (a.k.a “SKUs”) to provide performance and energy efficiency over diverse microservices. To this end, we first undertake a comprehensive characterization of the top seven microservices that run on the compute-optimized data center fleet at Facebook. Our characterization reveals profound diversity in OS and I/O interaction, cache misses, memory bandwidth utilization, instruction mix, and CPU stall behavior. Whereas customizing a CPU SKU for each microservice might be beneficial, it is prohibitive. Instead, we argue for “soft SKUs”, wherein we exploit coarse-grain (e.g., boot time) configuration knobs to tune the platform for a particular microservice. We develop a tool, μSKU, that automates search over a soft-SKU design space using A/B testing in production and demonstrate how it can obtain statistically significant gains (up to 7.2% and 4.5% performance improvement over stock and production servers, respectively) with no additional hardware requirements.","2575-713X","978-1-4503-6669-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8980331","Microservice;resource fungibility;soft SKU","","","9","","118","","6 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper deals with the challenge of estimating Fuel Oil Consumption (FOC) in the context of Weather Routing (WR). Given a plethora of features collected from the vessel’s Automatic Identification System (AIS) or on-board sensor installations, we examine how a predictive FOC scheme can be coupled with WR optimization algorithms in order to reduce the vessel’s FOC, emissions, and the overall cost of a voyage. In order to handle the amount of data required for FOC prediction, we employ a streaming pipeline that harvests data in real-time from different sources and processes them appropriately for visualization, causal analysis, and forecasting purposes. In this direction, we first conduct an exploratory analysis to examine and unveil the importance and inter-association between the various variables related to sea-keeping and weather features, in order to utilize them effectively in the context of a FOC predictive scheme. Furthermore, we introduce a novel recurrent neural network architecture that approximates ideally the underlying function describing the features and the vessel’s FOC by taking into account historical data, and we showcase the results. Finally, we demonstrate how the FOC prediction model can be coupled with a WR algorithm to propose the optimal route for a vessel in terms of FOC efficiency.","","978-1-6654-5890-0","10.1109/BigDataService55688.2022.00014","Stavros Niarchos Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9898181","big data collection;information processing;vessel data;fuel oil consumption;weather routing optimization;recurrent neural networks","Industries;Recurrent neural networks;Oils;Big Data;Routing;Prediction algorithms;Fuels","","9","","20","IEEE","27 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This allows for much simpler and faster application orchestration and management, especially in cloud-based systems, with the result being that orchestration systems themselves are becoming a key focus of computing research.Orchestration system research addresses many different subject areas, including scheduling, automation, and security. However, the key characteristic that is common throughout is the complex and dynamic nature of distributed, multi-tenant cloud-based microservice systems that must be orchestrated. This complexity has led to many challenges in areas such as inter-service communication, observability, reliability, single cluster to multi-cluster, hybrid environments, and multi-tenancy.The concept of service meshes has been introduced to handle this complexity. In essence, a service mesh is an infrastructure layer built directly into the microservices - or the nodes of orchestrators - as a set of configurable proxies that are responsible for the management, observability, and security of microservices.Service meshes aim to be a full networking solution for microservices; however, they also introduce overhead into a system - this can be significant for low-powered edge devices, as service mesh proxies work in user space and are responsible for processing the incoming and outgoing traffic of each service. To mitigate performance issues caused by these proxies, the industry is pushing the boundaries of monitoring and security to kernel space by employing eBPF for faster and more efficient responses.We propose that the movement towards the use of service meshes as a networking solution for most of the required features by industry - combined with their integration with eBPF - is the next key trend in the evolution of microservices.

In recent two years, 5G pilot services have been launched to deal with the drastic increase in mobile devices and application types. However, since 5G adopts a higher frequency than conventional 3G/4G, base stations must be densified. Therefore, virtualization resources for softwarization in various technologies (e.g., Virtualized RAN (Radio Access Network), Virtualized Core, Virtualized Applications) are more appreciated. In this research, we focus on edge computing, which is one of the cores of Beyond 5G, to utilize the virtualization resources. Critical potentials of edge computing are traffic reduction, low latency, and high security for mobile networks. However, various studies were made based only on numerical analysis or parts of the trial of the experiment due to a lack of technical preparation for end-to-end (E2E) environments (e.g., devices, RAN, Core, applications, human resources) with software/hardware flexibility. To show the state-of-the-art edge computing for Beyond 5G (B5G), we established a true E2E B5G Edge Cloud in Ookayama Campus of Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan. In addition, focusing on the effective use of computation resources in Edge Clouds as an advantage of edge computing, we proposed a cloud-native with network function deployment architecture for computation resource sharing in different Edge Clouds. Specifically, we focused on Virtualized CU (Central Unit) in RAN and proposed to operate CU-CP (Control Plane) and CU-UP (User Plane) in different Edge Cloud. Its feasibility is validated through a measurement.","2577-2465","978-1-6654-8243-1","10.1109/VTC2022-Spring54318.2022.9860668","National Institute of Information and Communications Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9860668","Edge Cloud;Virtualization;Proof-of-Concept;Micro-Service;Beyond 5G","Cloud computing;Vehicular and wireless technologies;5G mobile communication;Computer architecture;Throughput;Resource management;Virtualization","","9","","20","IEEE","25 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These characteristics render existing energy-conserving techniques ineffective when processors are idle due to the long transition time (order of 100$\mu$s) from a deep CPU core idle power state (C-state). While prior works propose management techniques to mitigate this inefficiency, we tackle it at its root with AgileWatts (AW): a new deep CPU core C-state architecture optimized for datacenter server processors targeting latency-sensitive applications.AW drastically reduces the transition latency from deep CPU core idle power states while retaining most of their power savings based on three key ideas. First, AW eliminates the latency (several microseconds) of savinglrestoring the core context when powering-off/-on the core in a deep idle state by i) implementing medium-grained power-gates, carefully distributed across the CPU core, and ii) reraining context in the power-ungated domain. Second, AW eliminates rhe flush latency (several tens of microseconds) of the LllL2 caches when entering a deep idle state by keeping LllL2 content power-ungated. A small control logic also remains ungated to serve cache coherence traffic. AW implements cache sleep-mode and leakage reduction for the power-ungated domain by lowering a core’s voltage to the minimum operational level. Third, using a state-of-the-art power efficient all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) clock generator, AW keeps the PLL active and locked during the idle state, cutting microseconds of wake-up latency at negligible power cost.Our evaluation with an accurate industrial-grade simulator calibrated against an Intel Skylake server shows that AW reduces the energy consumprion of Memcached by up to 71% (35% on average) with<1% end-to-end performance degradation. We observe similar trends for other evaluated services (MySQL and Kafka). AW’s new deep C-states C6A and C6AE reduce transition-time by up to 900$\times$ as compared to the deepest existing idle state C6, while consuming only 7% and 5% of the active state (C0) power, respectively.","","978-1-6654-6272-3","10.1109/MICRO56248.2022.00063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9923886","Energy Efficiency;power management;Latency Sensitive applications","Degradation;Program processors;Microarchitecture;Coherence;Market research;Energy efficiency;Generators","","9","","200","IEEE","26 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While clearly V2X-communication will play a significant role in all C-ITS deployments, several key components, such as the wireless communication technology and the message formats, are still evolving. This calls for a modular approach when designing C-ITS infrastructure, especially when considering a real world urban environment. Such environments are characterized by heterogeneous traffic light hardware and traffic management systems. This paper focuses on the modular architecture of the C-ITS pilot in Dresden. For example, a highly flexible communication stack is developed for this special purpose. It fully supports the message types standardized by European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) on the one hand, while on the other hand allowing the rapid implementation and test of novel message types and contents. This went hand in hand with the development of a modular roadside unit, enabling the rapid implementation of service applications on its central processing unit. In combination with a cloud-based backend, a real-time C-ITS service platform with a hybrid communication concept is developed. This paper presents a modular architecture and best practice guidelines based on experiences of the C-ITS pilot in Dresden. First results of research topics, such as latency measurements, are shown. The ongoing C-ITS deployment in Dresden is part of the initiative ""Synchrone Mobilität 2023"", which aims at advancing Intelligent Transport Systems. Focusing on automated and connected driving in urban areas, the research and development projects under its umbrella initiate scientific and technological developments and provide comprehensive test facilities. Automated and connected driving in urban areas requires not only simulations and test drives on test sites but also enormous testing effort under real traffic conditions.

The full exploitation of 5G relies on network slicing, a network virtualization technique where operators split a physical network among a wide number and variety of services, in accordance to their individual needs. However, experimentation with 5G-enabled services and measurement of key performance indicators (KPIs) over network slices is extremely challenging as it requires the deployment and coordination of numerous physical devices, including edge and cloud resources. In this paper, we introduce 5G-Slicer; an open and extensible framework for modeling and rapid experimentation of 5G-enabled services via a scalable network slicing emulator. Through modeling abstractions, our solution eases the definition of 5G network slices, virtual and physical fog resources, and the mobility of involved entities. With the blueprint of an emulated testbed at hand, users can create reproducible experiments to evaluate application functionality and KPIs by injecting load, faults and even changing runtime configurations. To show the wide applicability of 5G-Slicer, we introduce a proof-of-concept use-case that encompasses different scenarios for capacity management in a city-scale intelligent transportation service. Evaluation results exploiting real 5G data show that 5G-slicer presents, at most, an 11.7% deviation when comparing actual and emulated network Quality of Service (QoS).","","978-1-6654-9641-4","10.1109/IoTDI54339.2022.00008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9797405","Network Slicing;Edge Computing;Mobility","Cloud computing;Runtime;5G mobile communication;Scalability;Network slicing;Emulation;Transportation","","9","","30","IEEE","23 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To tackle this challenge, we present lifelong self-adaptation: a novel approach to self-adaptation that enhances self-adaptive systems that use ML techniques with a lifelong ML layer. The lifelong ML layer tracks the running system and its environment, associates this knowledge with the current tasks, identifies new tasks based on differentiations, and updates the learning models of the self-adaptive system accordingly.

Microservice architecture also becomes the de facto choice for designing a modern Cloud Native Network Function (CNF) due to its ability to decouple components of each CNF into multiple independently manageable microservices. Even though taking advantage of microservice architecture in designing CNFs solves specific problems, this additional granularity makes estimating resource requirements for a Production Environment (PE) a complex task and sometimes leads to an over-provisioned PE. Traditionally, performance engineers dimension each CNF within a Service Function Chain (SFC) in a smaller Performance Testing Environment (PTE) through a series of performance benchmarks. Then, considering the Quality of Service (QoS) constraints of a Service Provider (SP) that are guaranteed in the Service Level Agreement (SLA), they estimate the required resources to set up the PE. In this paper, we used a machine learning approach to model the impact of each microservice's resource configuration (i.e., CPU and memory) on the QoS metrics (i.e. serving throughput and latency) of each SFC in a PTE. Then, considering an SP's Service Level Objectives (SLO), we proposed an algorithm to predict each microservice's resource capacities in a PE. We evaluated the accuracy of our prediction on a prototype of a cloud native 5G Home Subscriber Server (HSS).

Lack of such knowledge can lead to uninformed merging and scheduling decisions that, in turn, can cause deadline violation of either the merged tasks or other following tasks. Accordingly, in this paper, we study the problem of estimating execution-time saving resulted from merging tasks with the example in the context of video processing. To learn the execution-time saving in different forms of merging, we first establish a set of benchmarking videos and examine a wide variety of video processing tasks-with and without merging in place. We observed that although merging can save up to 44% in the execution-time, the number of possible merging cases is intractable. Hence, in the second part, we leverage the benchmarking results and develop a method based on Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) to estimate the time-saving for any given task merging case. Experimental results show that the method can estimate the time-saving with the error rate of 0.04, measured based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).","","978-1-7281-7649-9","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS50907.2020.00004","Louisiana Board of Regents; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9407824","Task Merging;Oversubscription;Serverless;Cloud Computing;Video Stream Processing;Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT)","Processor scheduling;Merging;Measurement uncertainty;Streaming media;Benchmark testing;Boosting;Decision trees","","8","","22","IEEE","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, the reactive nature of the existing autoscaling solutions provided by major Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud services providers (CSP) heavily limits the ability of cloud applications for self-adaptation. The major reason of such limitations is the necessity for the manual configuration of the autoscaling rules. With the evolution of monitoring systems, it became possible to employ the data-driven approaches to derive the parameters of scaling rules in order to enable the autoscaling in advance, i.e. the predictive autoscaling. The change in the amount of requests to microservices could be considered as a reason to adapt the virtual infrastructure underlying the cloud application. By forecasting the amount of requests to cloud application, it is possible to estimate the upcoming demand to replicate the microservices in advance. Hence, anticipation of the demand on the cloud application helps to evolve its self-adaptive properties. In the scope of the paper, the authors have tested various extrapolation models on the real anonymized requests time series data for 261 microservices provided by the industry partner Instana. The tested models are: various seasonal ARIMA models with GARCH modifications and outliers detection, exponential smoothing models, singular spectrum analysis (SSA), support vector regression (SVR), and simple linear regression. In order to evaluate the accuracy of these models, an interval score was used. The time required to fit and use each model was also evaluated. Comparative results of this research and the classification of forecasting models based on the interval accuracy score and model fitting time are provided in the paper. The study provides an approach to evaluate the quality of forecasting models to be used for self-adapting cloud applications and virtual infrastructure.","1949-3681","978-1-5386-5172-8","10.1109/SASO.2018.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8614278","requests forecasting;self-adaptive cloud;microservice;seasonal ARIMA;GARCH;SSA;SVR","Forecasting;Time series analysis;Predictive models;Cloud computing;Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Smoothing methods","","8","","25","IEEE","17 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is not straightforward for a tenant to know in advance the computing amount that allows running the microservice optimally. This will impact the service performances and the infrastructure provider, particularly if the resource overprovisioning approach is used. To overcome this issue, we conduct in this paper an experimental study aiming to detect if a tenant’s configuration allows running its service optimally.

However, for many scenarios, such technical setting is not suitable for managing data requests of a large crowd. For example, when dealing with millions of data points, still many challenges arise for modern smartphones if calculations or advanced visualization features must be accomplished directly on the smartphone. Therefore, the work at hand proposes an architectural design for managing geospatial data of tinnitus patients, which combines a cloudnative approach with Big Data concepts used in the Internet of Things. The presented architectural design shall serve as a generic foundation to implement (1) a scalable backend for a platform that covers the aforementioned crowdsensing requirements as well as to provide (2) a sophisticated stream processing concept to calculate and pre-aggregate incoming measurement data of tinnitus patients.

Relevant existing research work has mainly focused so far on virtual machine and container migration to intermediate fog nodes and on migration of very simple functions to IoT endpoints (to preserve their limited resources available). In this paper, we originally concentrate on the gap associated with benefitting from fog functionality at resource-powerful IoT endpoints, to create a continuum deployment that glues IoT devices and the cloud. In particular, this paper originally presents a middleware that manages application deployment and life-cycle by simplifying and optimizing management operations such as device configuration and application constraint satisfaction. The proposed solution particularly fits highly articulated scenarios with large numbers of IoT devices and intermediate fog nodes, by supporting the opportunity to offload functionality in a split way between IoT endpoints and edge nodes.

However, real-time PTing requires enhanced instrumentation in the building, such as meters and sensors. Considering the usage and age of buildings, different buildings impose more stringent requirements for sensing equipment in terms of applicability of PTing.

The management of the heat produced by servers has been experimentally less explored than the management of their power consumption. It can be partly explained by the lack of a public testbed that provides reliable access to both thermal and power metrics of server rooms. In this paper we propose SeDuCe, a testbed that targets research on power and thermal management of servers, by providing public access to precise data about the power consumption and the thermal dissipation of 48 servers integrated in Grid'5000 as the new ecotype cluster. We present the chosen software and hardware architecture for the first version of the SeDuCe testbed, highlighting its current limitation and proposing some improvements that will increase its relevance.","1847-358X","978-9-5329-0087-3","10.23919/SOFTCOM.2018.8555773","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8555773","Datacenters;Scientific testbed;Thermal management;Power management;Green computing","Servers;Temperature sensors;Power demand;Cooling;Temperature measurement;Thermal management;Monitoring","","7","","10","","2 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although simulation plays a pivotal role in niche cases, it is an undervalued tool in the broader enterprise context. Its proliferation has not kept up with recent technological advances such as big data, cloud computing, graphics processing units clusters, and cross-layer enterprise integration. Based on such new developments, new capabilities can be realized that go beyond single-purpose simulations, and are an excellent fit for studying heterogeneous, independently developed System-of-Systems (SoS), in a multitude of scenarios in complex and dynamic enterprise environments. Co-simulation efforts can provide new insights on the enterprise operations including compelling visualizations of possible simulated alternatives, thereby assisting decision makers in their strategy selection. To move beyond niche applications, however, simulated systems need to integrate in real-time, a continually increasing amount of data (both real and simulated), stemming from various domains and their systems. This work presents a way to achieve such distributed simulations in modern enterprise environments, based on HighLevel Architecture (HLA), as well as their coordination via the Run-Time Infrastructure (RTI). In an example scenario featuring a co-simulation of a corporate electric vehicle fleet, it is shown how various software subsystems interact to enable business users to visually investigate scenarios, as well as how such a system can be deployed and operated within a modern enterprise IT landscape.","2474-2325","978-1-5386-3615-2","10.1109/SII.2019.8700423","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8700423","","Containers;Computer architecture;Tools;Data visualization;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Data models","","7","","21","IEEE","29 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the constant and rapid growth in IoT devices also brings new challenges due to constrained power and resources associated to them. One of the challenges is to provide seamless connectivity in mobile IoT. Secondly, IoT devices may stream enormous amount of data; hence, providing a solution that can effectively reduce service cost of data transfer. Finally, there are challenges in management and deployment of services running at mobile IoT Edge Gateway. In this context, containerized virtualization solution could play a key role in support of efficient management and deployment of microservices to provide seamless connectivity. This paper proposes a lightweight container-based virtualization technology for IoT, which employs Docker container-based microservices architecture for effectively deploying applications in a virtualized ecosystem. We evaluated the performance of the proposed solution on real IoT testbed using Raspberry Pi 3 as a mobile IoT Edge Gateway for network handover decision making among various alternatives, such as Wi-Fi, Radio, and Satellite. The results demonstrated better performance compared with the native environment, i.e., the one without introduction of a virtualization layer. The results also showed that the Docker container produces negligible resource overhead and can be used on resource constrained mobile IoT Edge Gateway devices like Raspberry Pi 3 for efficiently managing IoT application and services.","","978-1-5386-7975-3","10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8726693","Container virtualization;Internet of Things (IoT);service orchestration;Edge Computing;Mobility Management;Network Function Virtualization (NFV);Microservices;Network Handover","Internet of Things;Logic gates;Containers;Handover;Wireless fidelity;Virtualization","","7","","19","IEEE","3 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we introduce ALPACA, a framework to reduce QoS violations and overall application performance degradation for consolidated services. ALPACA reduces unnecessary high power consumption when there is no performance gain, and divides the power among the running services in a way that reduces the overall QoS degradation when the power is scarce. We evaluate ALPACA using four applications: MediaWiki, SysBench, Sock Shop, and CloudSuite's Web Search benchmark. Our experiments show that ALPACA reduces the operational costs of QoS penalties and electricity by up to 40% compared to a non optimized system.","2474-0756","978-1-5386-5139-1","10.1109/ICAC.2018.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8498125","power capping;power budgeting;power performance tradeoffs;performance degradation","Servers;Power demand;Quality of service;Degradation;Data centers;Actuators;Time factors","","7","","35","IEEE","21 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the onboard computing platforms typically have strong resource limitations, which may lead to significant delays and long mission times. To address this problem, we explore the potential of offloading heavyweight computations from the drone to nearby edge computing infrastructure. We discuss a concrete implementation for a service-oriented application software stack, which takes offloading decisions based on the expected service invocation time and the locations of the servers expected to be available in the mission area. We evaluate our implementation using an experimental setup that combines a hardware-in-the-loop and software-in-the-loop configuration. Our results show that the proposed approach can reduce the total mission time significantly, by up to 48% vs local-only processing, and by 10% vs more naive opportunistic offloading, depending on the mission scenario.","","978-1-6654-0291-0","10.1109/ICFEC51620.2021.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9458891","Drones;edge computing;service-oriented computing;computation offloading;location-aware computing","Runtime;Conferences;Data collection;Delays;Servers;Resource management;Application software","","7","","22","IEEE","21 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"HyperPlane: A Scalable Low-Latency Notification Accelerator for Software Data Planes","A. Mirhosseini; H. Golestani; T. F.

Datacenters rely on fast, efficient Software Data Planes (SDPs), which orchestrate data transfer between applications and I/O devices. Modern data planes are user-level software stacks, wherein cores spin-poll a large number of queues to avoid the attendant overheads of kernel-based I/O. Cores often poll empty queues before finding work in non-empty ones. Interrogating empty queues hurts peak throughput, tail latency, and energy efficiency as it often entails fruitless cache misses. In this work, we propose HyperPlane, an efficient accelerator for the notification mechanism of SDPs. The key features of HyperPlane are (1) avoiding iteration over empty I/O queues, unlike software-only designs, resulting in queue scalability, (2) halting execution when I/O queues are idle, leading to work proportionality and energy efficiency, and (3) efficiently sharing queues across cores to enjoy strong theoretical properties of scale-up queuing. HyperPlane is realized through a hardware subsystem associated with a familiar programming model. HyperPlane's microarchitecture consists of a monitoring set that watches for work arrival from I/O, and a ready set, which tracks ready queues and distributes work to cores based on various service policies and priority levels. We show that HyperPlane improves peak throughput by 4.1× and tail latency by 16.4× compared to a state-of-the-art SDP.","","978-1-7281-7383-2","10.1109/MICRO50266.2020.00074","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9251997","software data plane;acceleration;spin-polling;notification","Microarchitecture;Scalability;Programming;Throughput;Software;Queueing analysis;Monitoring","","7","","101","IEEE","11 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Increasing availability of storage and processing devices closer to the data capture device, perhaps over a one-hop network connection or even directly connected to the IoT device itself, requires more efficient allocation of processing across such edge devices and data centers. We refer to these as ""vertical workflows"" - i.e. workflows which are enacted across resources that can vary in: (i) type and behaviour; (ii) processing and storage capacity; (iii) latency and security profiles.

We develop and evaluate two models for scoring individual log-events for anomalousness, namely an N-Gram model and a Deep Learning model with LSTM (Long short-term memory). Both are trained on normal log sequences only. We evaluate the models with long log sequences of Android stability testing in our company case and with short log sequences from HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) public dataset. We evaluate next event prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. The LSTM model is more accurate in stability testing logs (0.848 vs 0.865), whereas in HDFS logs the N-Gram is slightly more accurate (0.904 vs 0.900). The N-Gram model has far superior computational efficiency compared to the Deep model (4 to 13 seconds vs 16 minutes to nearly 4 hours), making it the preferred choice for our case company. Scoring individual log events for anomalousness seems like a good aid for root cause analysis of failing test cases, and our case company plans to add it to its online services. Despite the recent surge in using deep learning in software system anomaly detection, we found limited benefits in doing so.

It also introduces the concept of transition architectures from the field of enterprise architecture to fill the gap in adoption. It reviews the possibility of de-centralising energy optimally and the possibility of using an architecture roadmap of milestones (transition states) via transition architectures to enhance adoption rates. The paper evaluates features of distributed ledgers. It identifies the core features that can be introduced independent of each other, thereby making a minimal usable product in each transition state via transition architectures with a view of target state that would encompass all core features. It covers engaging the current participants (generators, transmission, distributors, metering, retailers, prosumers, banks, regulators and others); and how a gradual evolving nature via transition architectures would increase adoption due to smooth transition as the roles of current participants evolve while the market dynamics re-orchestrates. A discussion and proposal for a custom distributed ledger framework for energy domain balancing decentralisation, immutability, verification and transparency in a gradual manner; to address privacy, compliance, regulations and peer to peer trading is presented.","","978-1-7281-5299-8","10.1109/PECI48348.2020.9064650","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9064650","Blockchain;Hyper ledger;Digital Ledger;Dynamic Energy Resources;Peer to Peer Energy Trading","Computer architecture;Energy resources;Peer-to-peer computing;Dynamic scheduling;Privacy","","6","","43","IEEE","13 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Centralised methods for dynamic service placement in MEC require central access to control every server, which is challenging where servers belong to different administrative domains. Other approaches use distributed decision-making, but most of them do not consider cooperation between servers. Dynamic, distributed service placement can potentially provide workload orchestration and higher QoE. However, this is challenging where service demand patterns are non-stationary. This paper proposes a multi-armed bandit-based method where servers cooperatively decide to host service replicas by applying reinforcement learning that uses service characteristics and context information to minimise response time and backhaul traffic. By sharing cached services, the servers achieve better workload distribution while autonomously making placement decisions. The simulations demonstrate improvements in response time and reduction in backhaul traffic compared to close baselines.","2474-2473","978-1-6654-1683-2","10.1109/SCC53864.2021.00037","Science Foundation Ireland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9592440","Mobile edge computing;Reinforcement learning;Service caching;Service offloading;Service orchestration","Costs;Distance learning;Simulation;Decision making;Service computing;Reinforcement learning;Network architecture","","6","","36","IEEE","15 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A common area of application is the processing of continuous data streams from sensors, for example, IoT devices or performance monitoring tools. In addition to analyzing pure sensor data, analyses of data for groups of sensors often need to be performed as well. Therefore, data streams of the individual sensors have to be continuously aggregated to a data stream for a group. Motivated by a real-world application scenario, we propose that such a stream aggregation approach has to allow for aggregating sensors in hierarchical groups, support multiple such hierarchies in parallel, provide reconfiguration at runtime, and preserve the scalability and reliability qualities induced by applying stream processing techniques. We propose a stream processing architecture fulfilling these requirements, which can be integrated into existing big data architectures. We present a pilot implementation of such an extended architecture and show how it is used in industry. Furthermore, in experimental evaluations we show that our solution scales linearly with the amount of sensors and provides adequate reliability in the case of faults.","","978-1-7281-0858-2","10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9006452","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9006452","","Computer architecture;Topology;Reliability;Buildings;Power demand;Scalability;Production","","6","","20","IEEE","24 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

New and constantly evolving use cases continue to place performance demands, especially for low latency communications, as these are still challenges for the 3GPP-specified 5G design, and will have to be met by the 6G design. Therefore, it is helpful to re-examine several aspects of the current cellular network’s design and implementation.Based on our understanding of the 5G cellular network specifications, we explore different implementation options for a dis-aggregated 5G core and their performance implications. To improve the data plane performance, we consider advanced packet classification mechanisms to support fast packet processing in the User Plane Function (UPF), to improve the poor performance and scalability of the current design based on linked lists. Importantly, we implement the UPF function on a SmartNIC for forwarding and tunneling. The SmartNIC provides the fastpath for device traffic, while more complex functions of buffering and processing flows that suffer a miss on the SmartNIC P4 tables are processed by the host-based UPF. Compared to an efficient DPDK-based host UPF, the SmartNIC UPF increases the throughput for 64 Byte packets by almost 2×. Furthermore, we lower the packet forwarding latency by 3.75× by using the SmartNIC. In addition, we propose a novel context-level QoS mechanism that dynamically updates the Packet Detection Rule priority and resource allocation of a flow based on the user context. By combining our innovations, we can achieve low latency and high throughput that will help us evolve to the next generation 6G cellular networks.","","978-1-6654-6763-6","10.1109/6GNet54646.2022.9830519","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9830519","Cellular core;Low latency;SmartNIC","6G mobile communication;Cellular networks;Technological innovation;5G mobile communication;Scalability;Quality of service;Tunneling","","6","","34","IEEE","21 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, eminent challenges in automating data processing across the computing continuum still exist, such as scheduling heterogeneous devices across the Cloud, Fog, and Edge layers.

We evaluate $C^{3}$-MATCH using real-world road sign inspection and sentiment analysis workflows on a federated computing continuum across four Cloud, Fog, and Edge providers.

Despite recent advances in fog platforms, there exists no readily available testbed which can help researchers to design and evaluate fog applications on a truly IoT scale. The current fog prototyping tools are adapted from cloud middleware or network simulators to enable the evaluation of fog solutions in limited environments. This paper presents a framework and toolset integration that uses the Fogbed emulator to enable fog distributed testbeds in virtualized environments. Unlike current approaches, the proposed framework allows for the deployment and testing of fog components in a scalable way.

Combining it with Software Defined Networking (SDN) enables us to chain network services much easier and faster. The main idea of using these technologies is to consolidate several Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) into a fewer number of commodity servers to reduce costs, increase VNFs fluidity and improve resource efficiency. However, the resource allocation and placement of VNFs in the network is a multifaceted decision problem that depends on many factors, including VNFs resource demand characteristics, arrival rate, configuration of underlying infrastructure, available resources and agreed Quality of Services (QoS) in Service Level Agreements (SLAs). This paper presents a bottom-up open-source NFV analysis platform (NFV-Inspector) to (1) systematically profile and classify VNFs based on resource capacities, traffic demand rate, underlying system properties, placement of VNFs in the network, etc. and (2) extract/calculate the correlation among the QoS metrics and resource utilization of VNFs.

ICT components include not only Internet of Things (IoT) data sources spread across the city, but also traditional non-IoT data sources. Managing all ICT components in a smart city can be challenging and results in many complexities. Consequently, there is a need for ICT management architectures. Traditional solutions are often based on a centralized ICT architecture using Cloud technologies. Recently, the number of ICT components, services, and their corresponding complexities are growing, leading to large-scale ICT architectures. Centralized Cloud solutions cannot cope with the ever-expanding demands of this kind of architectures. The limitations of the centralized approaches necessitate the design of a new ICT architecture, using distributed technologies, for every layer and element of the city. Many solutions for management from Edge-to-Cloud (E2C) through distributed technologies are forthcoming, including Decentralized-to-Centralized ICT (DC2C-ICT) and Distributed-to-Centralized ICT (D2C-ICT) architectures. The DC2C-ICT architecture and its components work on their own tasks and are solely communicating with a centralized platform. On the other hand, components of the D2C-ICT architecture can work together to provide the services for the citizens across different layers from E2C. Therefore, the D2CICT architecture is less dependent on the central Cloud-based entity, but harder to design and manage. In this paper, an “Edge-to-Cloud-as-a-Service (E2CaaS) ” model is proposed together with a model on how to build efficient software services in smart cities through different layers of E2C. The most important tasks for building these services are the management of“Data/Database,” “Resources,” and “Network Communication and Cybersecurity issues”.","2375-0324","978-1-7281-4663-8","10.1109/MDM48529.2020.00079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9162334","Smart City;IoT;Edge-to-Cloud;Distributed-to-Centralized ICT architecture;Edge-to-Cloud-as-a-Service","Conferences;5G mobile communication","","6","","21","IEEE","7 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the containers require less resource footprint, consolidating it in servers might make resource availability sparse. In order to reduce the energy consumption of the cloud data center, we have proposed a green container-based consolidation of the services so that the maximum number of servers can be put into idle mode without affecting the application quality of experience. The service consolidation problem has been formulated as an optimization problem considering minimization of total energy consumption of the data center as the objective, and an algorithm named Energy Aware Service consolidation using baYesian optimization (EASY) has been proposed to solve the optimization. We have evaluated the EASY algorithm in simulation using python. The experimental results have shown that EASY improves the total energy consumption of the data centers. This improvement comes at the cost of a small increase of service response time as there exists a trade-off between energy consumption and service response time.","1938-1883","978-1-7281-5089-5","10.1109/ICC40277.2020.9149173","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9149173","Cloud Computing;Container;Service Consolidation;Energy Consumption;Bayesian optimization","Containers;Servers;Nickel;Data centers;Cloud computing;Energy consumption;Optimization","","6","","23","IEEE","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The growing demand for decoupling HW and application SW requires an increasing utilization of virtualization. On top of IT-grade HW, the virtualized network functions can be deployed to the cloud. However, to fulfill the strict requirements of telecommunication networks on cloud, there are special configurations and best practices that shall be followed. These led to the notion of `Telco-Cloud'. The rapidly increasing amount of cloud-based Virtual Network Functions introduced new concepts for dimensioning, deployment, operation, management, licensing, and monitoring. Several established availability and operability requirements and expectations are inherited also from the legacy world of Physical Network Functions, meanwhile the telecommunication world itself undergoes a continuous change towards the new worlds of Telco-Cloud and 5G.

Today due to high cost of energy, very high losses in the actual power system, risks occur due to nuclear and oil and gas energy, and globally environment changes are the way of motivating to convert these sources into conventional energy sources. So today is the era of SG with integrating of renewable energy resources to maximize the efficiency and reduce the cost and make the system more stable. Traditional power systems are converted into smart grids due high efficiency, more securable, more reliable, and especially highly protection of the user data and bi directional energy flow.

Moreover, network programmability will abstract the essential network/service and resource configuration, as well as the production and administration of policy lifecycles, as the number of local breakouts (both public and private) is anticipated to grow exponentially. Network programmability is the central point of interest for Hexa-X, the European 6G flagship project, which aims to facilitate the dynamic adaptation to changing network situations and requirements for the most efficient use of available resources. To explore such a critical enabler of futuristic mobile networks, this article addresses the role of network and service programmability and its impact on various aspects of 6G within the context of Hexa-X. In order to accomplish this, the article begins by discussing Hexa-X's proposed service Management and Orchestration (M&O) framework for 6G. Based on this framework, it identifies and explores in greater detail the programmability of four primary processes in 6G: expressing application and service requirements; service description models and profiling; monitoring and diagnostics; and reasoning.

Additionally, the offloading decision is influenced by the availability of the required software for the computation of the task of the mobile unit that may not be available at the cloudlet and has to be downloaded before starting the computation. The proposed offloading decision making and resource allocation problem is formulated as a global optimization problem. To handle higher numbers of mobile units in the network and also achieve a greatly faster convergence, a game theoretic algorithm for the individual offloading decisions is introduced.

The computation offloading is one of the most popular techniques used by developers as an effective way of saving energy on mobile devices, which consists on executing complex tasks in external servers with different purposes including save energy. Deciding towards offloading certain tasks requires to understand the influence of the amount of data, amount of computation, and the network profile. Several studies have investigated the influence of different wireless flavours, such as 3G, 4G and wifi, but no study has investigated the influence of the communication choices on the energy cost. Therefore, in this paper, we present an experiment we conducted to evaluate the energy consumption of different communication protocols and architectural styles, namely REST, SOAP, Socket and gRPC, when executing algorithms of different complexities and different input sizes and types. Results show that local execution is more economic with less complex algorithms and small input data. When it comes to remote execution, REST is the most economic choice followed by Socket. Moreover, our data show that computation offloading can save up to 10 time as much energy when compared to local execution for some executions configurations.","","978-1-5386-2098-4","10.1109/LATINCOM.2017.8240185","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8240185","","Batteries;Energy consumption;Sorting;Mobile handsets;Sockets;Servers","","5","","19","IEEE","28 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, IoT traffic can also be intermittent, so running applications constantly can be wasteful. Therefore, having a serverless edge cloud that is responsive and provides low-latency features is a very attractive option for a resource and cost-efficient IoT application environment.In this paper, we discuss the key components needed to support IoT traffic in the serverless edge cloud and identify the critical challenges that make it difficult to directly use existing serverless solutions such as Knative, for IoT applications. These include overhead from heavyweight components for managing the overall system and software adaptors for communication protocol translation used in off-the-shelf serverless platforms that are designed for large-scale centralized clouds. The latency imposed by ‘cold start’ is a further deterrent.To address these challenges we redesign several components of the Knative serverless framework. We use a streamlined protocol adaptor to leverage the MQTT IoT protocol in our serverless framework for IoT event processing. We also create a novel, event-driven proxy based on the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF), to replace the regular heavyweight Knative queue proxy. Our preliminary experimental results show that the event-driven proxy is a suitable replacement for the queue proxy in an IoT serverless environment and results in lower CPU usage and a higher request throughput.","","978-1-7281-7744-1","10.1109/NAS51552.2021.9605384","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9605384","Internet-of-Things;serverless;edge cloud","Energy consumption;Protocols;Conferences;Computer architecture;Throughput;Software;Sensors","","5","","17","IEEE","22 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A promising method for handling the resulting mixed-critical data flows is the fifth generation of mobile radio networks, i.e., 5G. It enables reliable communication in public and private infrastructures via network slicing. Here, a single physical network is split up into multiple slices, each addressing the requirements of various services and devices optimally. This enables cost-efficient communications based on widely available Information and Communications Technology (ICT) infrastructures. In this work we provide an integrated architecture as well as a physical cellular energy system testing setup. This is supported by an open-source 4G/5G software stack and gateways for handling mixed-critical grid communications. The physical testbed is located at the Smart Grid Technology Lab (SGTL) at TU Dortmund university and enables real-world analysis of relevant scenarios.

In the interest of programmer productivity and ease of scaling, workloads in data centers have shifted from single monolithic processes toward a micro and nanoservice software architecture. As a result, single servers are now packed with many threads executing the same, relatively small task on different data.State-of-the-art data centers run these microservices on multi-core CPUs. However, the flexibility offered by traditional CPUs comes at an energy-efficiency cost. The Multiple Instruction Multiple Data execution model misses opportunities to aggregate the similarity in contemporary microservices. We observe that the Single Instruction Multiple Thread execution model, employed by GPUs, provides better thread scaling and has the potential to reduce frontend and memory system energy consumption. However, contemporary GPUs are ill-suited for the latency-sensitive microservice space.To exploit the similarity in contemporary microservices, while maintaining acceptable latency, we propose the Request Processing Unit (RPU). The RPU combines elements of out-of-order CPUs with lockstep thread aggregation mechanisms found in GPUs to execute microservices in a Single Instruction Multiple Request (SIMR) fashion. To complement the RPU, we also propose a SIMR-aware software stack that uses novel mechanisms to batch requests based on their predicted control-flow, split batches based on predicted latency divergence and map per-request memory allocations to maximize coalescing opportunities. Our resulting RPU system processes 5. 7 × more requests/joule than multi-core CPUs, while increasing single thread latency by only 1. ×.","","978-1-6654-6272-3","10.1109/MICRO56248.2022.00040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9923866","SIMT;Data Center;Microservices;GPU","Data centers;Instruction sets;Memory management;Microservice architectures;Energy efficiency;Hardware;Central Processing Unit","","5","","153","IEEE","26 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, many different types of services need to provide mobility and consequently need to be migrated live. These can be offloaded algorithms from mobile devices, such as unmanned vehi-cles or robots, security services, communication services or classic control tasks. In particular, the latter place very high demands on determinism and latency. Here, it is of utmost importance that the downtime of the service is as low as possible. Since existing live migration approaches try to optimize multiple metrics such as downtime, migration time as well as energy consumption, which are equally relevant in the IT domain, it is not possible to use any of these approaches without adoptions. Therefore, a novel concept is proposed that builds on top of both existing migration approaches as well as virtualization technologies and aims primarily at minimizing service downtime. Furthermore, the concept is evaluated using a test environment. The results show that a sub-millisecond downtime can be achieved with the proposed concept. Moreover, the total migration time is in the range of several hundred milliseconds for the highest performance setting and two seconds for a non-invasive approach.","2163-5145","978-1-6654-8240-0","10.1109/ISIE51582.2022.9831601","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9831601","Live migration;Redeployment;container;control services;real-time;industrial automation;IT-OT convergence;mo-bility;flexibility","Measurement;Service robots;Mission critical systems;Process control;Real-time systems;Mobile handsets;Fourth Industrial Revolution","","5","","24","IEEE","25 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accordingly, Fog Computing, well supported by 5G, has been presented as the missing piece to provide along with cloud computing for virtually all applications. Application virtualization through containers has become more and more popular in the context of Cloud Computing as it simplifies live migration of the application or it’s selected tasks. The concept has been adapted to Fog computing too, However, time-critical task migration and in particular task offloading have not been sufficiently investigated. This work proposes a novel approach to offload time-critical application tasks from the application initiator to surrounding Fog nodes based on Docker containers and Checkpointing. The result is a flexible layer-oriented framework that effectively restricts the offloading to only necessary steps in only two message rounds. Performance evaluations show that through careful easy arrangements the framework performs remarkably well concerning offloading latency.","","978-1-7281-7299-6","10.1109/5GWF49715.2020.9221486","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9221486","5G;Fog Computing;Task Offloading;Checkpoints;Application Virtualisation;Latency-Critical Applications;Networked Vehicles","Performance evaluation;Cloud computing;5G mobile communication;Processor scheduling;Containers;Real-time systems;Time factors","","5","","29","IEEE","13 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As more data are being generated at the edge of the networks, the cloud model that enabled the affordable, on-demand, lease of these resources is ill-fitted to handle the volume and variety of data traveling to the core of the cloud and back. Some applications further showcase the limitations of the cloud by requiring strict low-latency communication and location awareness. Fog computing has been proposed as a solution to these issues that stem from the cloud's centralization. The fog is an emerging computing paradigm, conceived as an extension to the cloud, that aims to facilitate the creation of scalable infrastructures in the vicinity of the end-user. By decentralizing resources, it promises to optimize bandwidth consumption at the core and edge of the network while reducing latency between the service and the end-user. In this paper, we identify the requirements needed to orchestrate loads in the Cloud-Fog continuum and propose an architecture, built on available, open-source, components, that orchestrates loads with consideration to their geographical needs. We provide several levels of features (DNS-like service discovery, service mesh, health checks, encryption-as-a-service, among others) available to the operator and evaluate their quality-of-service implications, with respect to network latency and bandwidth, when compared to a simple deployment baseline.","1558-058X","978-1-6654-0379-5","10.1109/SoutheastCon45413.2021.9401822","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401822","cloud computing;fog computing;orchestration;IoT;architecture;latency","Scalability;Computer architecture;Bandwidth;Quality of service;Containers;Tools;Telemetry","","5","","41","IEEE","21 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To increase energy efficiency, informed decisions on workload placement and provisioning are essential. Micro-services and the upcoming serverless platforms with more granular deployment options exacerbate this problem. For this reason, knowing the power consumption of the deployed application becomes crucial, providing the necessary information for autonomous decision making. However, the actual power draw of a server running a specific application under load is not available without specialized measurement equipment or power consumption models. Yet, granularity is often only down to machine level and not application level. In this paper, we propose a monitoring and modeling approach to estimate power consumption on an application function level. The model uses performance counters that are allocated to specific functions to assess their impact on the total power consumption. Hence our model applies to a large variety of servers and for micro-service and serverless workloads. Our model uses an additional correction to minimize falsely allocated performance counters and increase accuracy. We validate the proposed approach on real hardware with a dedicated benchmarking application. The evaluation shows that our approach can be used to monitor application power consumption down to the function level with high accuracy for reliable workload provisioning and placement decisions.","2474-0756","978-1-7281-2411-7","10.1109/ICAC.2019.00018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8831214","Energy efficiency, serverless, micro-services, code offloading, DevOps","Power demand;Data centers;Power measurement;Load modeling;Monitoring;Hardware;Software","","5","","38","IEEE","12 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Server, as backbone of cloud computing, has been developing and evolving with diverse challenges of preserving data integrity, increasing availability, minimizing planned downtime, especially in high temperature ambient (HTA) data center environment So, rock robust server system design for reliability, availability, and serviceability (RAS) are crucial for cloud service providers. Memory errors in server are among the most common hardware causes of machine crashes in production sites with large-scale systems. The higher temperature environment, the more errors. The typical response to memory failures is to replace any affected memory modules, which makes memory modules among the most commonly replaced server components. So, memory failures and their correction are very costly. Based on data collection and failure analysis from Baidu infrastructure maintenance group, server system memory (uncorrectable error) failure rate is Top 1 in data center. For reducing memory failure rate and related server downtime, Baidu developed an advanced server handling memory correctable and uncorrectable errors throughout a ""6 pillars"" complete application stack, from the underlying hardware to the scheduling system. Such solutions involve three components: (1) reliability, how the solution preserves data integrity; (2) availability, how it guarantees uninterrupted operation with minimal degradation; and (3) serviceability, how it simplifies proactively and reactively dealing with failed or potentially failed components. Availability is not an independent vector.

Specifically, this work presents DANSM, a software-defined, dynamic and autonomous network slice management middleware for 5G-based IIoT use cases, such as adaptive robotic repair. The novelty of our approach lies in (1) the use of multiple M/M/1 queues to formulate a 5G network resource scheduling optimization problem comprising service-level and system-level objectives; (2) the design of a heuristics-based solution to overcome the NP-hard properties of this optimization problem, and (3) the implementation of a software-defined solution that incorporates the heuristics to dynamically and autonomously provision and manage 5G network slices that deliver predictable communications to IIoT use cases. Empirical studies evaluating DANSM on our testbed comprising a Free5GC-based core and UERANSIM-based simulations reveal that the software-defined DANSM solution can efficiently balance the traffic load in the data plane thereby reducing the end-to-end response time and improve the service performance by completing 34% more subtasks than a Modified Greedy Algorithm (MGA), 64% more subtasks than First Fit Descending (FFD) and 22% more subtasks than Best Fit Descending (BFD) approaches all while minimizing operational costs.","2643-7929","979-8-3503-9730-7","10.1109/NCA57778.2022.10013530","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10013530","5G;Software Defined Networking (SDN);Dynamic network slice management;Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);Autonomous systems;Predictable performance","5G mobile communication;Service robots;Wireless networks;Quality of service;Telecommunication traffic;Real-time systems;Time factors","","4","","24","IEEE","16 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose a multicriteria approach for microservice-based applications' auto-scaling. By means of a layered architecture, we present a hybrid auto-scaling solution that ensures an autonomous auto-scaling of microservices to enable them maintaining their specific required qualities. Moreover, a cooperative policy is applied to maintain the system overall qualities by identifying a compromise plan when the adaptation concerns different qualities of the system. The present work combines the efficiency of the hybrid strategy with the multicriteria selection principle to reach an autonomous-cooperative auto-scaling approach.","2161-5330","979-8-3503-1008-5","10.1109/AICCSA56895.2022.10017677","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10017677","Cloud Computing;Quality of Service;Microser-vice architectures;Auto-scaling;Containers","Schedules;Processor scheduling;Computational modeling;Microservice architectures;Quality of service;Computer architecture;Large-scale systems","","4","","12","IEEE","20 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Towards that end, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) are promising solutions to facilitate the deployment of the required user’s service instances within an approximately one-hop communication range. However, discovering and assigning such service instances to the UE to maintain a high service availability is still an open challenge in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards due to the UE mobility and Telco network heterogeneity. This paper proposes an SDN-based dynamic service discovery and assignment framework for a distributed MEC infrastructure. The proposed framework considers various decision parameters such as UE’s location, the service instance’s demand (i.e., resource utilization), the network link status, and the service instance performance requirements (i.e., service profile) to offer a generic solution for discovering and assigning the service instances to the UE.

Moreover, the selection of diverse assumptions and distributions create additional complications on a fair comparison between platforms and reduces the ability to reproduce the experiment. In this paper, we compare synthetic workloads used in prior research with the Eucalyptus cloud traces. We find that the distributions employed in the synthetic workloads are not always in-line with the real usage pattern. Therefore, to deliver realistic and reproducible research outcomes, we propose a trace-driven research methodology and showcase an experimental design which employs a workload trace and simulation method.

With the growing demand for utilities for detailed and real-time energy measurements at customers, utility companies need to migrate technology from AMR to Advance Metering Infrastructure (AMI). This effort will require the development of information technology and supporting equipment. One of them is the Meter Data Management System (MDMS). It is an essential part of the AMI system to handle the utility company's business processes and the Service Level Agreement (SLA). This paper discusses developing an MDMS for an electricity company's AMI energy measurement system using an IoT-based approach. It leads to a massive meter reading in a certain interval period and handling such conditions required implementing the event-based streaming architecture. The Head-End System (HES) uses the enhanced AMR-based one. The measurement results of the proposed MDMS-HES for AMI show the reading process can handle massive meter reading precisely and detect any abnormal measurement quantities. The reading interval only takes 37.5% of the SLA required by the utility company to read 100% of the meter population. This advanced capability can guarantee better measurement results and guarantee the certainty of the company's revenue.","","978-1-6654-4354-8","10.1109/ICHVEPS53178.2021.9601104","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9601104","AMI;MDMS;IoT;Streaming platform","Meters;Sociology;Energy measurement;Companies;Real-time systems;Power systems;Statistics","","4","","6","IEEE","18 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the implementations of this model is a system that is maintained automatically without any human intervention. The path to NoOps involves not only precise and fast diagnostics but also reusing as much knowledge as possible after the system is reconfigured or changed. The biggest challenge is to leverage knowledge on one IT system and reuse this knowledge for diagnostics of another, different system. We propose a framework of weighted graphs which can transfer knowledge, and perform high-quality diagnostics of IT systems. We encode all possible data in a graph representation of a system state and automatically calculate weights of these graphs.

However, most of the MDM systems designed today are generalised to such an extent that they do not consider the relational structure of electrical system. Furthermore, these systems do often not restrict themselves to specific data latency requirements. To address this issue, this paper presents the Database & Analytics (DB&A), an open reference implementation for a MDM system that is instantiated as a web service. Its design is based on a set of design goals, an explicitly addressed data latency scope and five real-world scenarios. We present an abstract model of the metering hierarchy that allows MDM systems to be used as compositional services, forming a service tree. Moreover, we provide implementation details about analytic functions to support the service tree. The DB&A is evaluated on a cloud and embedded platform using a subset of data constructed from a case study that includes 8 months of real data. The results show that the DB&A complies with the boundaries of the defined data latency scope for the cloud and embedded platform.","","978-1-5090-2253-3","10.1109/SOSE.2016.26","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7473004","Data management;RESTful;service-oriented architecture;smart grid;web service","Smart grids;Web services;Computer architecture;Databases;Real-time systems;Business;Smart meters","","4","","35","IEEE","19 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Protecting sensitive data in the dynamic, heterogeneous, and decentralized cloud-to-edge continuum is very challenging. This paper describes a solution: FogProtect, an integrated set of four technologies to protect data in the cloud-to-edge continuum. Fog-Protect addresses four concerns: (i) control and enforcement of distributed data access and usage; (ii) management of distributed data protection policies; (iii) risk assessment for data assets in the cloud-to-edge continuum; (iv) automated optimisation and adaptation to address identified risks. FogProtect operates dynamically, reacting to system changes or detected vulnerabilities to keep the data secure across the cloud- to-edge continuum. This paper describes an overview of the FogProtect concept, discusses each of the four approaches, and illustrates their usage for the protection of data in three real-world use cases.","","978-1-6654-9956-9","10.1109/CCGrid54584.2022.00037","Horizon 2020(grant numbers:871525); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9826058","fog computing;edge computing;data protection;security;privacy","Cloud computing;Smart cities;Data protection;Distributed databases;Organizations;Production facilities;Sensors","","4","","29","IEEE","19 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, mobile devices' computing power usually limits them from inferring complex DNN models timely. Edge intelligence has emerged to help mobile apps offload DNN inference tasks to powerful edge servers for accelerated inference services. One major challenge that edge intelligence faces is maintaining a satisfactory quality of service when users move across edge servers. To address this issue, we propose a novel solution to help improve the quality of inference services for real-time video analytics applications that use chained DNN models. This solution includes two schemes: one maximizes the use of mobile devices to improve inference quality during the handover between edge servers, and the other provides offloading decisions to minimize the end-to-end inference delay when edge servers are available. We evaluate the proposed scheme using a DNN-based realtime traffic monitoring application through testbed and simulation experiments. The results show that our solution can improve inference quality by 52% during handover compared to the greedy algorithm-based solution.","","978-1-6654-8611-8","10.1109/SEC54971.2022.00079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9996800","edge computing;handover;model chain;quality of inference","Performance evaluation;Analytical models;Visual analytics;Handover;Real-time systems;Mobile handsets;Mobile applications","","4","","19","IEEE","2 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These numerous IoT devices collect enormous amounts of data, which are then transferred to the cloud for further processing and analysis. Most of these tasks are delay-sensitive and require processing within their deadline. These tasks require high-speed computing and storage resources for their processing. Although the cloud layer provides enormous processing and storage capability, we can not ignore the amount of delay in response generation. Thus, other two lower layers, i.e., the Edge layer and the fog layer, should also be considered to develop an efficient algorithm for task scheduling and load balancing. These three layers vary in terms of resource availability and communication latency. Currently, the increased focus of many new researchers on improving the performance metrics in the cloud architecture, such as energy efficiency, resource utilization, and latency, leads to the requirement of a detailed review of previous work done in this area. Although many review articles are on the web, most focus only on a single layer. Thus, The current study considers all three layers, edge, fog, and cloud, to present a detailed systematic review of algorithms based on load balancing and scheduling at task and VM levels. This study aims to compare and analyze the available papers based on the focused layers, the methodology used, performance matrices, advantages, and future scopes.","","978-1-6654-8268-4","10.1109/ICICT55121.2022.10064614","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10064614","energy-efficiency;task and VM scheduling;load-balancing;edge computing;fogcomputing;cloud computing","Measurement;Cloud computing;Systematics;Computer architecture;Load management;Scheduling;Energy efficiency","","4","","17","IEEE","20 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The design of such systems bears high risk due to uncertainty in requirements related to service function and behavior, operation environments, and evolving customer needs. Such risks and uncertainties are well known in the IT sector, where DevOps principles ensure continuous system improvement through reliable and frequent delivery processes. A modular and service-oriented system architecture complements these processes to facilitate IT system adaptation and evolution.Objective: This work proposes a method to use and extend the Digital Twins (DTs) of IPSS assets for enabling the continuous optimization of CPS service delivery and the latter’s adaptation to changing needs and environments. This reduces uncertainty during design and operations by assuring IPSS integrity and availability, especially for design and service adaptations at CPS runtime.Methodology: The method builds on transferring IT DevOps principles to DT-enabled CPS IPSS. The chosen design approach integrates, reuses, and aligns the DT processing and communication resources with DevOps requirements derived from literature.Results: We use these requirements to propose a DT-enabled self-adaptive CPS model, which guides the realization of DT-enabled DevOps in CPS IPSS. We further propose detailed design models for operation-critical DTs that integrate CPS closed-loop control and architecture-based CPS adaptation. This integrated approach enables the implementation of A/B testing as a use case and central concept to enable CPS IPSS service adaptation and reconfiguration.Conclusion: The self-adaptive CPS model and DT design concept have been validated in an evaluation environment for operation-critical CPS IPSS. The demonstrator achieved sub-millisecond cycle times during service A/B testing at runtime without causing CPS operation interferences and downtime.CCS CONCEPTS• Computer systems organization~Embedded and cyber-physical systems •Computer systems organization~Architectures","2157-2321","978-1-4503-9305-8","10.1145/3524844.3528057","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9800053","DevOps;Digital Twin;Self-Adaptation;CPS;Deployment;IPSS","Adaptation models;Runtime;Uncertainty;Adaptive systems;Computational modeling;Systems architecture;Digital twins","","4","","71","","23 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These metrics depend on the sum of computation and network latency needed to generate and deliver a video frame to the Head-Mounted Display (HMD) and the power consumption on the HMD. Recent research shows that Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) can support mobile HMDs to reduce their computing latency, but its potential to maintain the acceptable end-to-end (E2E) latency and reduce power consumption under high mobility conditions remains unexplored. This paper proposes Service Chaining Graph (SCG), an orchestrator to split VR applications into atomic services and deploy them across HMDs and MEC servers according to an optimization problem that aims to jointly minimize latency and energy consumption. Through simulations, we show that SCG reduces E2E latency by up to 74% in three high-mobility user-dense scenarios compared to four widely used service-migration strategies against a moderate increase in power consumption. Unlike other approaches, SCG can find a balance between average latency and energy consumption by migrating services between MEC servers and HMDs according to a policy depending on application requirements.","2576-6813","978-1-6654-3540-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM48099.2022.10001403","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10001403","Mobile Virtual Reality;Multi-access Edge Computing;Service Function Chaining;Service Offloading;End-to-end Latency and Energy Optimization","Measurement;Energy consumption;Solid modeling;Power demand;Multi-access edge computing;Resists;Quality of service","","4","","14","IEEE","11 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing CPU power-saving techniques degrade the performance of these applications due to the long transition latency (order of 100$\mu$s) to wake up from a deep CPU idle state (C-state). For this reason, server vendors recommend only enabling shallow core C-states (e.g., CC1) for idle CPU cores, thus preventing the system from entering deep package C-states (e.g., PC6) when all CPU cores are idle. This choice, however, impairs server energy proportionality since power-hungry resources (e.g., IOs, uncore, DRAM) remain active even when there is no active core to use them. As we show, it is common for all cores to be idle due to the low average utilization (e.g., 5-20%) of datacenter servers running user-facing applications. We propose to reap this opportunity with AgilePkgC (APC), a new package C-state architecture that improves the energy proportionality of server processors running latency-critical applications. APC implements PC 1A (package C l agile), a new deep package C-state that a system can enter once all cores are in a shallow C-state (i.e., CC1) and has a nanosecond-scale transition latency. PC 1A is based on four key techniques. First, a hardware-based agile power management unit (APMU) rapidly detects when all cores enter a shallow core C-state (CC1) and triggers the system-level power savings control flow. Second, an IO Standby Mode (IOSM) places IO interfaces (e.g., PCIe, DMI, UPI, DRAM) in shallow (nanosecond-scale transition latency) low-power modes. Third, a CLM Retention (CLMR) mode rapidly reduces the CLM (Cache-and-home-agent, Last-level-cache, and Mesh network-on-chip) domain’s voltage to its retention level, drastically reducing its power consumption. Fourth, APC keeps all system PLLs active in PC 1A to allow nanosecond-scale exit latency by avoiding PLL re-locking overhead. Combining these techniques enables significant power savings while requiring less than 200ns transition latency, $\gt250\times$ faster than existing deep package C-states (e.g., PC6), making PC 1A practical for datacenter servers. Our evaluation based on an Intel Skylake-based server shows that APC reduces the energy consumption of Memcached by up to 41% (25% on average) with <0.1% performance degradation. APC provides similar benefits for other representative workloads.","","978-1-6654-6272-3","10.1109/MICRO56248.2022.00065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9923869","power;energy;thermal management","Degradation;Power demand;Program processors;Power system management;Random access memory;Microservice architectures;Systems architecture","","3","","131","IEEE","26 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The software embedded in CPSs has a long life-cycle, requiring constant evolution to support new requirements, bug fixes, and deal with hardware obsolescence. To date, the development of software for CPSs is fragmented, which makes it extremely expensive. This could be substantially enhanced by tightly connecting the development and operation phases, as is done in other software engineering domains (e.g., web engineering through DevOps). Nevertheless, there are still complex issues that make it difficult to use DevOps techniques in the CPS domain, such as those related to hardware-software co-design. To pave the way towards DevOps in the CPS domain, in this paper we instantiate part of the reference architecture presented in the H2020 Adeptness project, which is based on microservices that allow for the continuous deployment, monitoring and validation of CPSs. To this end, we elaborate a systematic methodology that considers as input both domain expertise and a previously defined taxonomy for DevOps in the CPS domain. We obtain a generic microservice template that can be used in any kind of CPS. In addition, we instantiate this architecture in the context of an industrial case study from the elevation domain.","","978-1-6654-3910-7","10.1109/ICSA-C52384.2021.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9425852","Microservices;DevOps;Cyber-Physical Systems","Systematics;Software architecture;Conferences;Taxonomy;Computer architecture;Cyber-physical systems;Software","","3","","23","IEEE","10 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is no curative treatment due to a lack of understanding of the pathophysiology. Early detection with a proper customized rehabilitation program can slow the disease’s progression and extend their independent living. Furthermore, the objective and real-time monitoring of gait patterns is also important as it can be used to adjust treatment programs and follow up the clinical progress effectively. However, the assessment nowadays is typically depending on a subjective FOQ questionnaire. This paper proposes a low-cost wearable IMU sensor that integrates cloud computing technology to monitor and assess PD patients’ gait. The device uses a single IMU sensor, which combines a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer, to record dynamic acceleration and perform gravity compensation.

To this end, applying artificial intelligence to model the behavior can play a key role in improving operational efficiency and over-consumption detection. Most of the energy over-consumption detection approaches make use of external devices such as smart plugs or designed for smart buildings rather than computing devices. Through this paper, a new architecture is proposed in which we extract real-time execution traces after identifying the suspicious running applications using the dynamic binary instrumentation technique. The output of this step is fed to a data analytic framework to detect any behavioral anomalies such as over-threshold energy consumption. Finally, depending on the decision made by the anomaly detection step, some sensors might be switched to the standby mode in order to meet the essential expectations for other sensors or services. Since we have a resource-constrained embedded system and a real-time decision-making constraint on sensor control, the amount of computation that could be done in real-time varies a lot. Accordingly, the desired performance may dictate how, when, and where the processing operations might occur (on the embedded system or on a remote server). This work is mainly focused on anomaly detection operations using tracing data analysis.

Therefore, any application running in such an environment must reduce the volume of communication caused by their presence. All the state of the art network simulators focus on specific parts of the network stack. Due to this specialization, the application interface is simplified in a way, that often only fictive and abstract applications can be simulated. However, we want to gain insights about the interoperability between routing and real application for the purpose of reducing communication costs. For this purpose, we propose our new simulator SIMORA in this contribution. In order to demonstrate the possibilities of SIMORA, we deploy a simple distributed application. Then, we develop advanced techniques like the dynamic content multicast to reduce the number of messages and the volume of data sent. In our experiments, we achieve reductions of up to 94% in number of messages and 29% in bytes transferred over the network compared to the traditional multicast approach.","","978-1-6654-9524-0","10.1109/ICFEC54809.2022.00013","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9799165","Simulator;Multicast;Multi Hop Network Topology;Application-Simulation","Costs;Conferences;Routing;Routing protocols;Interoperability;Edge computing","","3","","30","IEEE","20 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such services are deployed through a sandboxing platform to ensure proper isolation among services from different users. Due to the lightweight nature, containers have become increasingly popular to support such sandboxing. However, for supporting effective and efficient data center resource usage with minimum resource footprints, improving the containers' consolidation ratio is significant for the cloud service providers. Towards this end, in this paper, we propose an exciting direction to significantly boost up the consolidation ratio of a data-center environment by effectively managing the containers' states. We observe that many cloud-based application services are event-triggered, so they remain inactive unless some external service request comes. We exploit the fact that the containers remain in an idle state when the underlying service is not active, and thus such idle containers can be checkpointed unless an external service request comes. However, the challenge here is to design an efficient mechanism such that an idle container can be resumed quickly to prevent the loss of the application's quality of service (QoS). We have implemented the system, and the evaluation is performed in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. The experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithm can manage the containers' states, ensuring the increase of consolidation ratio.","1573-0077","978-3-903176-32-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463966","Container;State Management;Service Management;Cloud Computing;Container Migration;Checkpointing","Checkpointing;Cloud computing;Data centers;Heuristic algorithms;Quality of service;Containers;Linear programming","","3","","26","","30 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

BenchPilot instantiates the underlying cluster, performs repeatable experimentation, and provides a unified monitoring stack in heterogeneous Micro-DCs.

On the other hand, the deployment of a variety of digital services for broadband Internet access may complicate telecom operations. When more digital appliances, such as set-top boxes and IP cameras, are deployed at home, more configurations are required in both CPEs and POPs. CWMP is a management protocol between CPEs and auto configuration servers (ACSs) for remote management of those home network devices. It simplifies the service activation and configuration, and provides functionalities of diagnostics and monitoring. The scalability of ACS is an important issue as more CPEs and more configurations are needed, especially when a lot of Internet of Things (IoT) are widely adopted.

During elevators' lives, their software continues to evolve, e.g., due to hardware obsolescence, requirements changes, vulnerabilities, and bug corrections. Such continuous evolution demands the continuous testing of industrial elevators with the minimum manual effort possible. To this end, we present a tool, whose core component is a domain-specific language (DSL) with which a user can specify test oracles at a higher level of abstraction and independent of a testing level. The DSL also supports specifying uncertainty-aware test oracles to test elevators under various uncertainties inherent in them. Finally, the DSL is also equipped with test oracle generation that generates test oracle code automatically at the different DevOps testing levels (i.e., Software and Hardware-in-the-Loop test levels, and in operation) to enable reuse of test oracles across these levels. We evaluated this DSL with an industrial elevators case study at Orona's site to specify and generate test oracles. The evaluation showed that the high expressiveness of the DSL permits the high-level definition of test oracles in our industrial context.

Between Kernel Server and an application object is a layer called Deployment Manager (DM). Inbound and outbound communications to/from Sapphire objects will be intercepted and processed by deployment manager. Each DM provides one specific distributed system capabilities, e.g. caching, resource leasing, replication, data partitioning etc. Programmers selectively choose DMs to manage Sapphire objects. As part of this work (Amino), we re-implemented and extended Sapphire platform to support the invocation of methods on objects written in multiple languages and to support attaching multiple DMs to a Sapphire object for increased distribution capabilities.

Several API best practices and patterns have been proposed that could help API designers ensure API quality attributes such as reliability, availability, and performance. API Request Bundling, which is in focus of this paper, is one of those patterns that aims at optimizing performance. The pattern promises substantial performance gains, but can also lead to significant drawbacks such as increased development effort and application complexity. So far, there is little to no rigorously acquired knowledge to judge whether applying Request Bundling is worth the costs in a given Microservice architecture. To improve this situation, we performed an empirical study based on a Microservice-based open source business application using realistic workload scenarios. To estimate the performance impact of Request Bundling, we derived a regression model and performed a multivariate regression analysis. These selected regression models can help distributed system engineers and architects to estimate the gain in performance, in terms of round-trip time, with or without Request Bundling. Our approach followed in the paper, can be customized to other Microservice architectures or to study other performance-related Microservice patterns.","2474-2473","978-1-6654-1683-2","10.1109/SCC53864.2021.00060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9592439","API Request Bundling;Modeling;Microservices;Cloud;Performance","Costs;Conferences;Service computing;Computer architecture;Performance gain;Reliability engineering;Multivariate regression","","3","","19","IEEE","15 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing data center scheduling systems tightly pack containers to save power. However, with the growth of multi-tiered applications, there is a significant need to account for the affinity between application components, to minimize communication overheads and latency. Centralized container scheduling systems using graph partitioning algorithms cause a significant number of task migrations, with associated downtime.We design pMACH, a novel distributed container scheduling scheme for optimizing both power and task completion time in data centers. It minimizes task migrations and packs frequently communicating containers together without overloading servers. pMACH operates at peak energy efficiency, thus reducing energy consumption while also providing greater headroom for unpredictable workload spikes. We also propose in-network monitoring using smartNICs (sNIC) to measure the communications and then perform scheduling in a hierarchical, parallelized framework to achieve high performance and scalability. pMACH is based on incremental partitioning and it leverages the previous scheduling decision to significantly reduce the number of containers moved between servers, avoiding application downtime.Both testbed measurements and large-scale trace-driven simulations show that pMACH saves at least 13.44% more power compared to previous scheduling systems. It speeds task completion, reducing the 95th percentile by a factor of 1.76-2.11 compared to existing container scheduling schemes. Compared to other static graph-based approaches, our incremental partitioning technique reduces migrations per epoch by 82%.","2643-3303","978-1-6654-4131-5","10.1109/ICNP52444.2021.9651911","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9651911","Data center scheduling;power saving;cost saving;meeting SLA","Data centers;Power measurement;Power demand;Protocols;Scalability;Containers;Scheduling","","3","","58","IEEE","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, decision making in current management platforms are addressed separately in different cloud stack layers. These isolated active management decisions may degrade the total performance of the cloud system. Since, cloud computing platforms lack an integrated analytics and management capability, in this paper, we propose an integrated platform to detect and predict situations where corrective actions are required. First, a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) is trained and updated by collected data to calculate the causal dependencies among various entities in different cloud service layers. The correlation values are then fed into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the future states. States that violate the Service Level Agreement(SLA) of cloud services are learned with training data, and if the forecasted states threaten the SLA of cloud services, associated events are generated to trigger management actions. Next, management actions are assigned a different set of events using a reinforcement learning approach. A set of experiments based on collected data from a real cloud service environment is conducted to validate the proposed approach. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the current management solutions and improves web request response time by up to 7% and decreases SLA violation by 79% in the context of web application auto-scaling.","2159-6190","978-1-5386-7235-8","10.1109/CLOUD.2018.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8457782","Cloud Computing, Dynamic Bayesian Network, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Algorithm","Cloud computing;Measurement;Correlation;Neural networks;Bayes methods;Monitoring;Clouds","","3","","33","IEEE","11 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The monitoring could be augmented by adding also optimization aspects that could decrease the energy/costs. Up to now the optimization is performed by using building and context (district) data, but with no or rough evaluation of comfort conditions delivered to the occupants. The work presented in this paper is derived from the ENERGIS project that takes into account individual buildings and districts including detailed comfort conditions representing a novelty in the Energy Management System. The monitoring is used to locally sense the energy demand while the optimization is performed at two different scales. The first optimization tries to consider different aspects related to the thermal management of rooms, supported by a novel sensor that is able to evaluate the comfort taking into account the room model and to control the thermal actuators to track a comfort set-point. The second level of optimization starts from the collected data from each building to set-up a district model that is able to map and then predict the energy demand enabling an energy management that is built on the concept of “sharing”. This paper outlines the overall system architecture that exploits the benefit of IoT also showing the first optimization level performed on a business office showing the overall pipeline that starts from the sensing of environment and ends with the control of actuators to track an optimized set-point.","","978-1-5386-4643-4","10.1109/MESA.2018.8449168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8449168","","Buildings;Optimization;Energy management;Monitoring;Actuators;Meteorology;Thermal management","","3","","28","IEEE","30 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SLA clauses represent key aspects in the relationship between them. In order to enforce service reliability and SLA compliance, a continuous monitoring of Quality of Service metrics is required. Since policy breach is usually subject to expensive penalties, using external entities acting as trustful references is a common practice in order to avoid frequent legal disputes, external entities are usually required to verify it. However, coordination between different actors to agree in one transaction is difficult, because it can open up possibilities for multiple fraud attempts. We argue that this can be done more efficiently using Smart Contracts, programs that are executed in a blockchain. Such data is stored in a distributed structure without the need of an external entity to ensure data integrity and reliability. Smart contracts can also makes easy the charging or possibly compensating SLA violations. In this paper we propose a solution empowered by smart contracts in order to simplify, and to automate the process of SLA validation, i.e, verify if the contract is being respected. We perform some experiments and evaluate a proof of concept using data from a real network infrastructure in Brazil.","","978-0-7381-0495-9","10.1109/Blockchain50366.2020.00077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284773","Blockchain;Service Level Agreement;Smart Contracts;Quality of Service","Measurement;Law;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Quality of service;Reliability;Monitoring","","2","","29","Crown","11 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Realization and management of these services is assumed to take place centrally, and according to well-defined policies established by city authorities. However, the proliferation of connected devices and crowd-sensing made it possible for ad hoc services to emerge before strict policies and architectures were enforced, and with little provision of interoperability. Furthermore, many existing services in today's cities use networks of privately-owned smart devices, which confine such services to local domains because of ownership and corporate governance. We propose a resource cooperation approach that orchestrates access to connected devices across local domains in order to compose new and potentially large-scale services that are not necessarily bound by local ownership. The resource cooperation approach makes informed recruitment of network segments from local network domains in response to stakeholder queries, which will be posted to a centralized authority responsible for smart city services. Our approach aims at maximizing the utility of city-wide services while maintaining local governance and minimizing performance degradation of service provisioning within local domains. The approach will also facilitate the composition of new smart city services from existing heterogeneous resources, thus minimizing the need to deploy dedicated service infrastructures.","","978-1-4673-8511-4","10.1109/INNOVATIONS.2015.7381505","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7381505","smart city;resource cooperation;orchestration","Smart cities;Recruitment;Cities and towns;Stakeholders;Technological innovation;Pricing;Information technology","","2","","10","IEEE","14 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

PLEIADES combines the resilience of self-organizing overlays, with the expressiveness of an assembly-based design strategy. The result is a highly survivable framework that is able to dynamically maintain arbitrary complex distributed structures under aggressive crash failures. Our evaluation shows in particular that PLEIADES is able to restore the overall structure of a 25,600 node system in less than 11 asynchronous rounds after half of the nodes have crashed.","2158-3927","978-1-5386-5596-2","10.1109/DSN.2018.00062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8416514","invariant;topology;large scale systems;distributed systems;gossip;epidemic protocols;maintenance;resilience","Shape;Protocols;Topology;Peer-to-peer computing;Structural rings;Resilience;Maintenance engineering","","2","","41","IEEE","23 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such a change will have a substantial impact on the incentives to create new business, and through this, it has the potential to impact investments and macroeconomic growth, job creation in all industries and job reallocation in the ICT sector, and public finance accounts, through the direct impact on the public sector spending and the indirect one on the tax revenues.

Therefore, leveraging virtualization technology to deploy networks as virtualized network functions (VNFs) garnered attention. It helps the network operators and service providers to consolidate several VNFs on fewer of-the-shelf servers. This results in reducing the capital and operational expenditures while improving the resource efficiency. However, moving network functions from proprietary devices to standard servers comes with the profound cost of performance degradation. In order to overcome any performance issues to ensure service level agreement (SLA) requirements and before taking the solutions to real world, a sufficient verification and validation of VNFs is required. This is where Network Service benchmarking (NSB) plays a crucial role. NSB identifies any performance compromising bottlenecks by systematically evaluating the capacity of general purpose hardware resources, also know as network function virtualization infrastructure (NFVI), used to host single or multiple VNF instances. This paper presents a benchmarking methodology and framework to extract the correlation among the VNF quality of services (QoS) metrics and NFVI key performance indicators (KPls). For evaluation, VoerEir Touchstone platform is used to execute iPerf based benchmarking application to generate UDP based workload between VNFs.

Scrap management becomes the key point in cost reduction since it could comprise up to the 50% of the overall production costs. Technological innovations promise to be the driver to improving raw material management, shortening its acquisition time and reducing the waste during the metallurgical process. Expensive raw materials require a huge involvement of plant resources, and are highly dependent on the human factor. All the quality and logistics decisions belong to the judgment of the operators, increasing the chance of non-conformities (e.g., erroneous classification, material discharged in the wrong location, error loading material in the buckets). To overcome these issues, online classification of the scrap is the keystone. Starting from the arrival of scrap at the plant, through the acceptance of the delivery note and the check-in of the carriers, Automatic Scrap Classification gives support to inbound-scrap control and classification, enabling real-time traceability of the scrap inside the bays. The Quality Control System will benefit from all the details of the material used in production. Danieli Automation implemented the Q-ASC a system that, leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and deep learning techniques, can assist scrap classification procedures through computer vision and automatic scrap recognition. The goal of scrap identification is to localize and assign a specific class label to a given visual sample of scrap or inert/hazardous material. The classification can be conducted using different methodologies based on material shapes or dimensions. Q-ASC is the entry point for the Scrap Yard Management and can be considered as the central data hub for managing the scrap inbound to the plant, connecting all the systems requiring reliable scrap data.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-8671-9","10.1109/IJCNN55064.2022.9892611","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9892611","scrap;classification;recognition;scrap yard","Visualization;Technological innovation;Costs;Production;Raw materials;Software reliability;Steel","","2","","18","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of programmable network hardware to perform part of the processing at line rate can drastically increase the throughput while retaining the flexibility.This work presents a new framework, called CHIMA, which extends the capabilities of other frameworks proposed in the literature for the deployment of heterogeneous Service Function Chains (SFCs). Heterogeneous SFCs comprise a combination of virtual functions meant to be executed in containers running on general purpose hardware and of functions for programmable switches written using the P4 language. CHIMA exploits programmable data planes to perform real time monitoring of the services through In-band Network Telemetry and uses the collected information to guarantee the requested levels of performance by redeploying and rerouting sections that are affected by adverse conditions, allowing applications with critical requirements to be deployed as SFCs.The solution has been tested by emulating various topologies and services on the FOP4 platform with bmv2 switches. The analysis shows that the system is capable of detecting faults in the order of hundreds of milliseconds, and the overhead it causes in the process of redeployment is negligible compared to the startup time of functions. Measurements also reveal that the current bottleneck for the runtime relocation of heterogeneous functions is the redeployment and reconfiguration of P4 programs.","2693-9789","978-1-6654-0694-9","10.1109/NetSoft54395.2022.9844124","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9844124","Network Function Virtualization;Service Function Chains;Programmable Data Planes;In-band Network Telemetry","Runtime;Service function chaining;Containers;Throughput;Real-time systems;Hardware;Time measurement","","2","","22","IEEE","3 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The objective of this work is the elaboration of requirements for ML integration in Cyber Physical System (CPS) and the added value of modularization in CPS-related ML tasks. As the paradigm of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) be-comes firmly established, principles for determining an optimized placement of the different ML pipeline modules in distributed systems are required. A collaborative cross-company use-case management framework KOSMoS is used to discuss selected benefits of using MLOps in industrial scenarios.","2637-9511","978-1-6654-6828-2","10.1109/MECO55406.2022.9797080","Federal Ministry of Education and Research(grant numbers:02P17D022); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9797080","CPS;ML;MLOps;Deployment;Modularization","Training;Manufacturing industries;Embedded computing;Digital systems;Pipelines;Collaboration;Machine learning","","2","","24","IEEE","21 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there are still many QoS-sensitive use-cases where data and service availability, network latency, and throughput needs to be further addressed. Partial solutions to these problems came in Fog and Edge computing, providing computation and data closer to end-user network devices. But these concepts still do not fully address the issues of offline data availability and network latency. A potential answer to these questions could be the concept of dew computing - an additional layer in the existing client-server architecture, operating on end devices to achieve the highest possible level of data synchronization between data in the cloud and local devices, which in the standard Cloud-Fog-Edge architecture relies strictly on connectivity.

In the IoT, the collaborating entities encompass both physical and virtual resources, interactions occur both in an active and programmed way as well as by chance, and therefore it is necessary to deal with expected but also emerging behaviors of the collaborating parties. In this paper, we first discuss the main features that make IoT a unique ecosystem, and as such, calls for new software development solutions. We claim that there is a need to rethinking the techniques and methodologies for developing IoT systems and applications. Novel models, architectural approaches and techniques should be proposed, or existing ones should be adapted to deal with the high heterogeneity, dynamism, serendipity and interdependencies that are typical of the IoT ecosystem. We then analyze and discuss potential key design solutions that deserve a deeper understanding in order to pave the way for the building of this new generation of systems.

A decentralized system could be a solution to remove the dependency from a central authority. Moreover, due to the rapid growth of mobile device usage, the availability of decentralization must not be limited only to desktop computers. In this work we aim at studying the possibility to use mobile devices as a decentralized file sharing platform without any central authorities. This was done by implementing Asterism, a peer-to-peer file-sharing mobile application based on the Inter-Planetary File System. We validate the results by deploying and measuring the application network usage and power consumption in multiple different devices. Results show that mobile devices can be used to implement a worldwide distributed file sharing network. However, the file sharing application generated large amounts of network traffic even when no files were shared. This was caused by the chattiness of the protocol of the underlying peer-to-peer network. Consequently, constant network traffic prevented the mobile devices from entering to deep sleep mode. Due to this the battery life of the devices was greatly degraded.","2573-7562","978-1-7281-0463-8","10.1109/MobileCloud.2019.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8710656","decentralized file sharing;peer-to-peer;mobile;Sailfish OS;InterPlanetary File System","Peer-to-peer computing;Mobile handsets;Protocols;File systems;Servers;Mobile applications;Power demand","","2","","34","IEEE","13 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, we adopted the initial population creation by 1,000 mutations of each individual, extended the approach by inception layers, implemented it as island model to facilitate scalability and achieved on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset 99.75%, 94.35% and 89.90% test accuracy respectively. Besides, our model is strongly focused on high availability empowered by the deployment in our bare-metal Kubernetes cluster. Our results show that the introduced multi-objective neural architecture search can easily handle even the loss of nodes and proceed the algorithm within seconds on another node without any loss of results or the necessity of human interaction.","","978-1-6654-3577-2","10.1109/IPDPSW52791.2021.00094","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9460405","neural architecture search;genetic algorithm;island model;kubernetes;microservices;multi-objective;high availability;scalable;bare-metal","Distributed processing;Scalability;Neural networks;Sociology;Clustering algorithms;Metals;Computer architecture","","2","","22","IEEE","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The overall application functionality results from complex interactions of many decoupled services, each having its operational specificity. Due to this complexity, the manual configuration of these systems is very arduous, error-prone and likely to impair the quality of service, leading to malfunctioning services, lowering availability and accruing costs. Identifying the optimal solution to simultaneously optimize availability and costs, whilst meeting service level objectives remains a challenge for professionals developing solutions using cloud services. This paper proposes a mathematical formulation of a bi-objective problem to identify the optimal set of solutions for the system configuration. Empirical evaluation of the proposed approach in a case study of a real industrial scenario results in an R-Squared of 0.85, an MSE of 0.021 and an optimization accuracy of 0.928.

This PIM renaissance finds itself in a very different computing landscape from the one twenty years ago, as more and more computation shifts to the cloud. Most PIM architecture papers still focus on best-effort applications, while PIM’s impact on latency-critical cloud applications is not well understood.This paper explores how datacenters can exploit PIM architectures in the context of latency-critical applications. We adopt a general-purpose cloud server with HBM-based, 3D-stacked logic+memory modules, and study the impact of PIM on six diverse interactive cloud applications. We reveal the previously neglected opportunity that PIM presents to these services, and show the importance of properly managing PIM-related resources to meet the QoS targets of interactive services and maximize resource efficiency. Then, we present PIMCloud, a QoS-aware resource manager designed for cloud systems with PIM allowing colocation of multiple latency-critical and best-effort applications. We show that PIMCloud efficiently manages PIM resources: it (1) improves effective machine utilization by up to 70% and 85% (average 24% and 33%) under 2-app and 3-app mixes, compared to the best state-of-the-art manager; (2) helps latency-critical applications meet QoS; and (3) adapts to varying load patterns.","2378-203X","978-1-6654-2027-3","10.1109/HPCA53966.2022.00083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9773228","","Three-dimensional displays;Stacking;Quality of service;Computer architecture;Resource management;Servers","","2","","74","IEEE","17 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Highly geo-distributed edge computing resources that are managed by independent and competing service providers pose new challenges in terms of resource allocation and effective resource sharing to achieve a globally efficient resource allocation. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based model for allocating computing resources in an edge computing platform that allows service providers to establish resource sharing contracts with edge infrastructure providers apriori using smart contracts in Ethereum. The smart contract in the proposed model acts as the auctioneer and replaces the trusted third-party to handle the auction. The blockchain-based auctioning protocol increases the transparency of the auction-based resource allocation for the participating edge service and infrastructure providers. The design of sealed bids and bid revealing methods in the proposed protocol make it possible for the participating bidders to place their bids without revealing their true valuation of the goods. The truthful auction design and the utility-aware bidding strategies incorporated in the proposed model enables the edge service providers and edge infrastructure providers to maximize their utilities. We implement a prototype of the model on a real blockchain test bed and our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability and performance efficiency of the proposed approach.","","978-1-6654-9956-9","10.1109/CCGrid54584.2022.00052","IBM(grant numbers:CNS-2000681); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9826039","Edge Computing;Blockchain;Smart Contract;Incentive Design;Resource Allocation","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Scalability;Smart contracts;Prototypes;Quality of service;Blockchains","","2","","32","IEEE","19 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To that end, this paper presents a profiling-based methodology that effectively matches edge computational tasks with the available devices to best satisfy programmer-defined non-functional requirements. Edge tasks are divided into microservices, which are then profiled for their resource utilization. To execute each task, the runtime consults the profiling results to determine the optimal device-to-microservice matching. We realize our methodology as μHTA, whose service-oriented architecture manages the heterogeneity of edge environments and optimally executes microservices on the available mobile devices. We evaluated μHTA by applying it to two realistic edge mobile applications.

Hence, this study lays down the fundamentals of a framework for dynamic and event-driven orchestration towards a fully decentralized edge. It provides a blockchain-based delivery platform for containerized applications registered with their resource requirements through a registry on a distributed file system. The decentralized resource manager running on the metrics scraped from the host and the virtualization platform, i.e., Docker in our implementation, dynamically optimizes the resources allocated to each container.

Moreover, offloading inference to a cloud server facilitates deployment of neural network-based applications on resource-constrained devices. Depending on the application goals and execution context of the application, the optimal deployment on either cloud server or mobile device varies during the lifetime of an application. In this paper, we propose a context-aware middleware that enables optimization of deployed application software to satisfy the application’s functional goals in accordance with changing execution context and environmental conditions. We facilitate system design through the abstraction of deployed software components as states and make use of finite state machines and contextual triggers to model the reconfiguration of the system. We evaluate our framework using a real-world nutritional monitoring application via food image recognition deployed in a two-tier mobile and cloud architecture. We compare the proposed solution with various static deployments of the application and show that our approach can react to changing application goals at run-time in order to reduce server load and thereby increase scalability.","","978-1-6654-0876-9","10.1109/WoWMoM54355.2022.00031","KU Leuven; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9842849","deep learning;offloading;context awareness;inference","Wireless communication;Cloud computing;Image recognition;Scalability;Mobile handsets;Real-time systems;Servers","","1","","32","IEEE","9 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we focus on the capacity aspect of the MEC infrastructure to ensure the services have enough resources during the migration process. We note that the distributed and decentralized nature of MEC networks requires the additional endorsement of the capacity information reported by the network nodes, which is especially critical since MEC nodes can be hacked or tampered with, leading to failures during the migration process.

In order to improve network security without compromising on QoS performance, redundant calculations must be reduced, which requires design of a performance tuning machine learning layer. Most of the research work done in this area of machine learning model design, focuses on reducing these redundancies via use of low complexity models, light weight mechanisms for trust evaluation, or simplifying key-exchange & other cryptographic processes. But these reductions in complexity also introduce security vulnerabilities into the system, for instance, using a light-weight trust model introduces trojan horse like attacks, while, using a low complexity cryptographic mechanism facilitates cryptanalysis. In order to reduce the computational complexity needed during security patch deployments, and improve overall quality of service (QoS) for wireless networks, this text proposes an augmented trust enabled QoS aware MAC model with intelligent blockchain sharding. The model works in 4 phases, wherein, initially an augmented trust model is implemented, which assists in improving QoS of network during routing. This is followed by design of a medium access control (MAC) model, which assists in further improving network QoS via an incremental learning layer that reduces packet contention, link quality issues, etc. Due to use of augmented trust layer, and incremental learning MAC model, various privacy & security loopholes are added to the network, which are handled via use of a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus based blockchain model. The PoS model is very secure, has high traceability, but is moderately scalable, because of exponential relationship between number of blocks & computational complexity of mining. In order to reduce this complexity, and maintain a high QoS performance, this text proposes an intelligent blockchain sharding model that divides the underlying PoS blockchain into smaller shards, and manages each shard using tree-based hash range search model.","2157-0485","978-1-6654-6741-4","10.1109/ICETET-SIP-2254415.2022.9791799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9791799","Blockchain;sharding;QoS;Trust;MAC;machine learning;incremental learning","Computational modeling;Wireless networks;Scalability;Quality of service;Machine learning;Routing;Blockchains","","1","","24","IEEE","15 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, numerous computing resources for software execution are available in manufacturing environments. The increased use of software and distributed systems is constantly raising the complexity of the software deployment process. Often, and specifically in manufacturing, software is subject to technological or usage requirements limiting possible resources related to the execution of the software. Since deployment decisions are often made manually without a profound basis, this leads to wrong decisions and to resources not being put to their best use. Also, the performance quality of software execution suffers with security gaps occurring and additional costs arising. Existing software deployment concepts are very generic and focus on cloud. They do not address the specific needs of operational technology and manufacturing environments. This work identifies important evaluation criteria for software deployment in manufacturing environments, based on a requirements analysis. The requirement analysis systematically analyzes cloud, fog, and edge environments, as well as software applications and system resources in manufacturing environments. The aim is to identify deployment-relevant resource properties and software requirements. The comparison, evaluation, elimination, and specification of the collected information results in a catalog of deployment-relevant criteria for selecting technically suitable options for a deployment decision. These criteria support decisions during the software deployment process. Also, these criteria provide the basis for automated and dynamic software deployment decisions in manufacturing environments.","","978-1-6654-9996-5","10.1109/ETFA52439.2022.9921690","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9921690","Software deployment;Requirements analysis;Manufacturing environments","Cloud computing;Costs;Digital transformation;Software;Manufacturing;Complexity theory;Software reliability","","1","","27","IEEE","25 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The architecture introduces in-network intelligence, designing intelligent agents as the fundamental unit which is used as a building block in autonomous network system design. This work focuses on the dynamic agent placement problems in edge/cloud data centers. Agents are softwarized and intelligent versions of network functions that are traditionally implemented in hardware such as firewalls, packet gateways, etc. This paper, based on a combination of proactive and reactive solutions, considered decision accuracy in developing an intelligent decision algorithm that can be used in the prediction agent design. The proactive decision is based on a deep learning prediction algorithm using time-series workload forecasting. However, in case of unforeseen events that are missing from the historical dataset, the proactive decisions could be less reliable. Therefore, network-state feedback should be considered to determine the current network conditions using the change in instant arrival rate as a reactive decision. Then combining it with the proactive decision should be able to capture the unpredictable traffic spikes. The result is used to determine the number and type of agents to instantiate at a given time in the edge/cloud data centers.

Smart meters provide information at the consumer level, which could be used as the main source for real-time energy micro-transactions, however, one of the main concerns about direct transactions is information security. Conventional electricity markets rely on centralized information exchange, nevertheless, when intra-day, distributed, electricity consumption and production exchanges are required between customers, this approach might not be enough. This paper presents a proof-of-concept for using Blockchain as a tool for managing the operational transactions in a DC microgrid. The distributed nature of this technology provides an inherently safer approach, by providing an immutable database for transaction history. One of the challenges of using this technology, however, is the required computing power at the nodes and the limited capacity available in the smart meter. To overcome these issues, the authors used a distributed computing technology, -edge computing-, where computation and storage are located closer to the customer, to improve response times by handling the required computational tasks of the Blockchain tool. This approach proved not only to be practically viable but also, offers important insights about the scalability and capabilities of the technology.","","978-1-6654-2935-1","10.1109/TESC50295.2020.9656872","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9656872","Microgrids;Blockchain;Edge Computing;Smart Grids;DER","Transactive energy;Object oriented modeling;Computational modeling;Microgrids;Libraries;Smart meters;Blockchains","","1","","24","IEEE","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our approach enables cloud users to indicate their willingness to apply energy saving mechanisms to some of their virtual resources, hence giving infrastructure managers the ability to apply more efficient workload consolidation and to switch their hardware to very low-power states.

Yet novel usage scenarios shift their roles from basic data acquisition and forwarding to performing more sophisticated tasks such as data processing, local service provisioning and actuation. To meet their goals, horizontal or vertical collaboration and task distribution are often required; utilizing resources identified in the nearby communication environment or offered by remote, cloud- or edge-based services. However, different infrastructural and energy-related constraints can severely influence device's communication capabilities thus dictating the level of provided functionality. In this paper, we focus on the class of ubiquitous systems without permanent communication links, utilizing only sporadic communication with global computing infrastructure. Such systems exploit the short-term presence of third-party communication and computational resources in their environment, adapting their service level to available resource properties. Several identified communication and computation scenarios are described for such a resource constrained and time-variable environment, along with the incentive model for using and provisioning of short-term resources. A general model of adaptive distributed applications exploiting such sporadic communication and computation environment is presented, relying on the cloud- and edge-computing paradigms and microservices as its building blocks.","","978-953-233-090-8","10.23919/MIPRO.2017.7973566","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7973566","","Quality of service;Computational modeling;Cloud computing;Adaptation models;Mobile communication;Ubiquitous computing;Collaboration","","1","","25","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Elastic services are situation aware and can adapt themselves to the current execution environment dynamically to adhere to their Service Level Objectives (SLOs). This adaptation is achieved through Diversifiable Programming (DivProg), a new programming model which uses function annotations as interface between the service logic, its SLOs, and the execution framework. DivProg enables developers to characterize their services in a way that allows a third-party execution framework to run them with the flow and the parametrization that conforms to changing SLOs. We develop a prototype and perform an experimental evaluation which shows that elastic services can seamlessly adapt to heterogeneous platforms and scale with a wide range of input sizes, while adhering to their SLOs with little programming effort.","2165-963X","978-3-9031-7614-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8584964","IoT;services;adaptive;programming model","Cloud computing;Cameras;Programming;Hardware;Elasticity;Adaptation models;Servers","","1","","25","","23 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A number of factors can have a significant impact on resource management, such as the operating system and the software architecture.This study aimed to compare the power consumption, runtime performance and memory consumption of two software architectures: microservices and monolithic. The study was conducted using a constrained device, and to ensure that the results are not language-specific, three different programming languages were used: Go, Python and C++.

If this could be accomplished, its impact on the society would be enormous. This white paper from the IEEE Future Networks CTU Working Group endeavors to highlight the need to consider the CTU requirements in 5G and B5G networks in the standardization process, in the development of the use cases, and affordable solutions. In its Vision 2030 SDG (Sustainability Development Goals) the United Nations has proclaimed access to Internet as basic human right and has said that these goals cannot be achieved without affordable access to Internet by everyone on this planet. While there are numerous projects and initiatives ongoing around the world, these are fragmented and lack the critical mass and coordination to be able to impact the future standards, product development, and cost of deployment otherwise achievable by volume. Although difficult to pin down, to define a threshold for basic connectivity for all is important. But it would need to be flexible to adapt to changing times. It is the goal of the CTU group to create an open platform where the experts can bring their ideas, solutions, and potentially collaborate to create large global projects and influence the network service providers, manufacturers and their governments. This white paper defines the CTU working group's charter, scope, and provides a brief overview of the relevant stakeholders and linkages between them. Then the paper goes into the current status of the CTU landscape and where we want to reach to accomplish the vision of connecting everybody, especially those living in rural and remote areas. We present the various standards and industry fora and how they are interlinked. While technologies are available today, they need to be customized and optimized at the systems level to bring down the cost of the network in order to be affordable. In addition, the content needs to be relevant and in local languages to be useful, not to mention the need to offer innovative human computer interaction (HCI) solutions (that are not text based) so that people who are not literate or are digitally disadvantaged can easily use the devices and consume services. Another important area is that of flexible spectrum allocation regime at the lower range of the spectrum to increase reach and coverage. Use of renewable energy sources will enable deployment in remote areas where there is lack of power grid, or it is intermittent. Thus, this white paper identifies a number of technology gaps to be filled in by 5G and B5G networks, such that access is affordable and content and services are actually consumed by the targeted set of users. Technology aside, the need to develop innovative business models is a must to be commercially sustainable in the long-term. A number of such models, especially designed for the rural population, are proposed, such as Village Level Entrepreneur (VLE) Freemium (Free + Premium), revenue sharing among the chain of service providers, subsidized billing by USOF (Universal Service Obligation Funds). Finally, the white paper presents a 10-year roadmap starting from the current state to 3 years, 5 years and 10 years.","2770-7679","978-1-6654-6250-1","10.1109/FNWF55208.2022.00134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10056704","Digital Divide;5G;B5G;CTU;SDG;IEEE Future Networks;Rural and remote connectivity;United Nations;Societal impact of ICT;Network slicing;Spectrum management;content management;HCI;IoT;TV white space;Satellite;Community networks;VLE;InfoInternet;Internet Lite;Business models","Human computer interaction;Wireless communication;Costs;5G mobile communication;Sociology;Internet;Stakeholders","","","","53","IEEE","8 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Providing such services requires to decide how often to instantiate each component, where to place these instances in the network, how to chain them and route traffic through them. To overcome limitations of conventional, hardwired heuristics, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches for self-learning network and service management have emerged recently. These model-free DRL approaches are more flexible but typically learn tabula rasa, i.e., disregard existing understanding of networks, services, and their coordination.Instead, we propose FutureCoord, a novel model-based AI approach that leverages existing understanding of networks and services for more efficient and effective coordination without time-intensive training. FutureCoord combines Monte Carlo Tree Search with a stochastic traffic model. This allows FutureCoord to estimate the impact of future incoming traffic and effectively optimize long-term effects, taking fluctuating demand and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements into account. Our extensive evaluation based on real-world network topologies, services, and traffic traces indicates that FutureCoord clearly outperforms state-of-the-art model-free and model-based approaches with up to 51% higher flow success ratios.","2374-9709","978-1-6654-0601-7","10.1109/NOMS54207.2022.9789713","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9789713","network management;service management;AI;Monte Carlo Tree Search;model-based;QoS","Training;Monte Carlo methods;Network topology;Stochastic processes;Microservice architectures;Quality of service;Reinforcement learning","","","","54","IEEE","9 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the limited capabilities of sensors and to the increased rate of attacks on these systems, researchers started to propose architectures and deploy solutions that use encryption for increasing the security level. Moreover, neural networks can play a critical role in detecting abnormal activity in the network with the end goal of minimizing the effect of attacks and fixing the issues that are causing the unwanted behavior.

To address this gap, we propose an assessment method for cloud elasticity based on fuzzy hierarchical analysis. We use a fuzzy hierarchical model to quantitatively assess the qualitative metrics with a unified standard model. We compare three public cloud providers (Ali Cloud, HUAWEI Cloud, Tencent Cloud) as case studies and measure their cloud elasticity based on the proposed model on a cluster.

Adaptation of execution algorithms aimed not only to adapt execution process to distributed parallel environments with higher reliability and wider range of possible applications, but also to improve system dynamics model execution performance. For example, existing algorithms of model execution which are not ready for distributed environments will fail to complete modeling task in case of hardware failure, and optimized ones are able to smoothly transfer execution process from one node to another with minimal impact on overall model execution progress. Such capabilities help to save many resources and, especially, time on execution re-runs.

Mist computing brings a significant revolution in computer technologies. Instead of delegating control to gateways during data transmission, control is decentralised to end nodes, which reduces the network's communicational delay and thus increases throughput and helps in conserving bandwidth and battery power. To address latency-related issues and for increasing the efficiency of smart healthcare systems, this paper critically reviews existing techniques and proposes a heterogeneous approach to mist computing along with other cloud and fog computing environments. We use a delay-based KNN algorithm for IoHT.

It is a fundamental task for homeland security and crime prevention. Some video analytics tasks are being addressed by at the edge processing approach, which combines algorithmic with hardware development, within the camera system design. The at the edge processing approach looks for real-time performance on specific domains and low network bandwidth requirements. However, it implies that the already installed city-camera-network should be replaced and continuously updated since it introduces constraints to analytics capabilities related to cameras' characteristics and functionalities. Thus, city surveillance by the at the edge processing approach requires a large budget, and continuous investment, to keep the system working. In this paper, we present both faced challenges and obtained achievements during the design process of video-analytics-system software architecture. Interoperability, availability, and security were the prioritized quality attributes by the Quality Attribute Workshop method. A microservices and cloud-based design was the result of applying the Attribute Driven Design method, incorporating software engineering sustainability concerns. As a practical advantage, the designed system can work with the already installed city surveillance camera network and allows incorporating video analytics algorithms as the surveillance system evolves. The evaluation combined the functional and operative prototype as well as the ATAM method, according to which approach is more suited to evaluate a specific driver.

It is fundamental to extract value from the information we all are submerged in, thus motivating and supporting the decisions within our cities, which nowadays need transparency and practical evidence. Data visualization tools provide multiple perspectives and are meant to support decision makers, mining available data, with the help of graphical representations in order to ease the emersion of added value, as an initial point from which making inference, reasoning and simulation within our urban environments. And nonetheless, good data visualization provide intuitive evidence. In this paper we introduce a novel 3D urban data analysis framework for the smart city, which exploits the city itself and its buildings to convey data visualization. The novelty is realized thanks to a dynamic geographic tiling which binds the real city structure and the environmental data ""on the fly"", giving the opportunity to see the city changing as the data change. A prototype is proposed, which is based on a micro service architecture, open standards, and an immersive 3D map, aiming to support public decision makers in the process of environmental data analysis. To this extent, the current solution is built on the idea of replicability, accessibility and adaptation: it is location agnostic and does not depend on the particular position where the analysis takes place, it does not need human intervention or adjustments, once the services are instanced, and it is easily accessible, for the interface it is built on a web application.","","978-953-290-105-4","10.23919/SpliTech49282.2020.9243831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9243831","3D Visualization;Data Visualization;Open Source;Open Data;Smart City;WebGL","Three-dimensional displays;Data analysis;Smart cities;Buildings;Data visualization;Tools;Data mining","","","","44","","4 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Remote sensing is a common approach, especially in Indonesia. However, fixed stations are difficult to establish due to economic factors. A system that collects data from various point of observation to figure out the surrounding area, similar to and an alternative of fixed station, can be beneficial for Indonesia. Therefore, we propose a UHI monitoring system based on Internet of Things (IoT).

Temperature and humidity data are collected every minute and sent through the internet using MQTT protocol every hour. Gathered and stored data are subscribed automatically using the Amazon Web Service, and an API is provided to access the data.

Sensor nodes are capable of perceiving and transferring information to the BS (Bottom Station). Data transmission at sensor nodes necessitates a significant amount of energy.

CubeSats have been gaining scads of attention worldwide for their affordability and ease of construction by the educational community. To further enhance this, it is imperative for a simple and reliable communication technique and its ability to work on robust missions by enabling CubeSats in intelligent ways. The mission is targeted to be used at LEO; considering the size and some unplumbed areas of the planet, the CubeSats will work in tandem to perform the task of high resolution infrared thermal imaging over a decided area. The paper proposes a technology that can reduce the costs by deploying CubeSats and improving their lifetime and number of missions using TinyML and reprogrammability capabilities. Swarms of CubeSat deployed for this mission can be synchronized, without having any ground support with the help of onboard ML algorithms. Hence, the paper also proposes the use of TinyML for power optimization and efficient solar irradiance orientation. Both of the aforementioned features not only escalate the life of CubeSats but also can become capable of performing other missions during its lifetime. Thus, orbital re-programmability for CubeSats is also being contemplated in the paper. The use of TinyML and orbital reprogrammability can reduce the space debris by bringing in the factor of satellites' reusability and accessing celestial bodies while making the space environment less cluttered. Applying this technology in CubeSat missions has wide prospects in the exploration of different planets' landing site data that can be exploited for future space travel.","","978-1-6654-5699-9","10.1109/CSITSS57437.2022.10026358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10026358","CubeSats;TinyML;Reprogrammability","Space vehicles;Satellites;Costs;Planets;Space debris;Space missions;Synchronization","","","","19","IEEE","31 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To avoid interruptions to online services, resources (i.e., transient resources) are occupied at both original and destination servers during the migrations. Transient resources reduce the remaining capacity of servers, making server re-consolidation challenging. To tackle this problem, we leverage the previously proposed concept of resource exchange, which refers to a set of resource configurations such that an application running under any one of them has similar performance, thus these configurations are exchangeable and such a set is called exchangeable configuration set (ECS). Moreover, we adjust the load pressure of an application to change its ECS when there is no suitable configuration, and such a strategy is called load adjustment. In this paper, we propose a new server re-consolidation problem that maintains applications' QoS target and availability at the same time. We leverage a machine-learning algorithm to estimate the performance of applications, based on which the ECSs are constructed efficiently. We design a simulated annealing-based (SA) algorithm to optimally solve the scheduling plan. We evaluate the proposed approach using data from real-world latency-critical applications. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms two state-of-the-art baselines in terms of reducing the number of used servers by 10% on average and up to 29%.

Hence, we need to optimize the network to reduce the overall power consumption through Cloud based models, and deployment of power-efficient radio nodes. In this paper, we analyze the network evolution towards Cloud based Radio Access Network (CRAN) for a heterogeneous set of base stations such as those with Macro RRUs, Micro RRUs and Pico radio units. We derive the computational complexity using a flexible and ‘future-proof’ power model and apply it for the network.

Security requirements need to overlay and permeate through the different layers of 5G systems (physical, network, and application) as well as different parts of an E2E 5G architecture within a risk-management framework that takes into account the evolving security-threats landscape. 5G presents a typical use-case of wireless communication and computer networking convergence, where 5G fundamental building blocks include components such as Software Defined Networks (SDN), Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and the edge cloud. This convergence extends many of the security challenges and opportunities applicable to SDN/NFV and cloud to 5G networks. Thus, 5G security needs to consider additional security requirements (compared to previous generations) such as SDN controller security, hypervisor security, orchestrator security, cloud security, edge security, etc. At the same time, 5G networks offer security improvement opportunities that should be considered. Here, 5G architectural flexibility, programmability and complexity can be harnessed to improve resilience and reliability. The working group scope fundamentally addresses the following: •5G security considerations need to overlay and permeate through the different layers of the 5G systems (physical, network, and application) as well as different parts of an E2E 5G architecture including a risk management framework that takes into account the evolving security threats landscape. •5G exemplifies a use-case of heterogeneous access and computer networking convergence, which extends a unique set of security challenges and opportunities (e.g., related to SDN/NFV and edge cloud, etc.) to 5G networks. Similarly, 5G networks by design offer potential security benefits and opportunities through harnessing the architecture flexibility, programmability and complexity to improve its resilience and reliability. •The IEEE FNI security WG's roadmap framework follows a taxonomic structure, differentiating the 5G functional pillars and corresponding cybersecurity risks. As part of cross collaboration, the security working group will also look into the security issues associated with other roadmap working groups within the IEEE Future Network Initiative.","2770-7679","978-1-6654-6250-1","10.1109/FNWF55208.2022.00131","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10056734","5G Cybersecurity;security;privacy;data protection;reliability;resilience;mMTC;URLLC;SDN/NFV;cyber risk assessment and management;threat scenarios;cyber-attacks;security controls;mitigation;defense","5G mobile communication;Computer network reliability;Computer architecture;Network function virtualization;Complexity theory;Security;Risk management;Software defined networking;Convergence;Resilience","","","","24","IEEE","8 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Media service providers stream video content for their viewers, while worldwide users create and distribute videos using mobile or video system applications that significantly increase the traffic share. We propose a multilayer and pipeline encoding on the computing continuum (MPEC2) method that addresses the key technical challenge of high-price and computational complexity of video encoding. MPEC2 splits the video encoding into several tasks scheduled on appropriately selected Cloud and Fog computing instance types that satisfy the media service provider and user priorities in terms of time and cost. In the first phase, MPEC2 uses a multilayer resource partitioning method to explore the instance types for encoding a video segment. In the second phase, it distributes the independent segment encoding tasks in a pipeline model on the underlying instances. We evaluate MPEC2 on a federated computing continuum encompassing Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 Cloud and Exoscale Fog instances distributed in seven geographical locations. Experimental results show that MPEC2 achieves 24% faster completion time and 60% lower cost for video encoding compared to resource allocation related methods.

The virtual infrastructure, including networked virtual machines, for large scale applications, is often distributed, and involve resources not only from data centers, but also distributed Fog and Edge nodes. It is not always feasible to use resources all from a single provider. The provisioning of a complex virtual infrastructure requires dynamic partitioning of the topology and seamless configuration of the network, to meet the latency constraints of geolocation devices, to optimize the price and Service Level Agreements of the application. In many cases, the partition solution of a virtual infrastructure cannot be done in the design phase and has to consider the actual resource availability of providers at the provisioning stage. This paper presents a virtual infrastructure partitioning and provisioning solution with consideration of the QoS and resource constraints from the application.","","978-1-7281-3488-8","10.1109/SmartIoT.2019.00018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8896677","Cloud computing;virtual infrastructure;graph partitioning;Fog and Edge","","","","","26","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the restricted availability of such edge servers thwarts this interesting proposal. The virtual edge computing concept is discussed in this study as a way forward. By remotely accessing all assets, particularly edge routers, and making them readily accessible through endpoints, virtual edge bridges the internet, periphery, and swamp worlds.

However, the development of IIP is still in exploration, and the industry still lacks unified understanding of the composition, functions and their interrelationships of IIP. As a result, the IIPs construction presents a disorderly development trend, and is faced with problems and challenges of unclearness of development path, indeterminacy of technical system, and unsoundness of business model. So, this paper firstly constructs a reference architecture of IIP to clarify its hierarchical framework and core functions, so as to provide a general reference model for the industry to understand and jointly promote IIP construction. Secondly, an evaluation system is proposed to guide the healthy development of IIP. The evaluation framework is composed from three dimensions namely the foundation guarantee, key capability, value and benefit, and the specific evaluation index system is also given. Finally, the application process and method of IIP evaluation are described with a practical case.","","978-1-7281-3584-7","10.1109/EITCE47263.2019.9095040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9095040","Industrial internet platform (IIP);reference architecture;evaluation framework;evaluation indictor","Schedules;Tools;Computer architecture;Technological innovation;Libraries;Industries;Internet","","","","29","IEEE","18 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The results show that the algorithm can effectively improve the utilization of cloud resources compared with the traditional scheduling method, and guarantee the priority scheduling of services with high development possibility.","","978-1-6654-6766-7","10.1109/ICCASIT55263.2022.9986827","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9986827","cloud;service;scheduling;CloudSim","Cloud computing;Processor scheduling;Simulation;Optimal scheduling;Scheduling;Stability analysis;Real-time systems","","","","20","IEEE","27 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cloud computing is an emerging paradigm in which users, depending on their specific requirements, access to a shared pool of computing resources dynamically allocated. Cloud computing represents, with respect to Grid computing, the evolutionary step towards the implementation of a ubiquitous computing service. Such paradigm leverages on the infrastructural capabilities (compute, storage, and network) of modern data centers to provide an adequate level of computational power able to satisfy users' requests. However, trying to continuously increase such capabilities comes at the cost of an increased energy consumption. Energy efficiency is, therefore, one of the major challenges that cloud providers must address. The OPERA project aims at bringing innovative solutions to increase the energy efficiency of cloud infrastructures, by leveraging on modular, high-density, heterogeneous and low power computing systems, which are able to cover the whole computing continuum. To this end, the project will design a high-density server solution in which low power processors and FPGA devices will be used to accelerate cloud workloads. High-speed optical interconnections will be used to connect the proposed server with high-performance nodes, such as OpenPOWER-based machines. Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) represents a natural extension of cloud infrastructures since they can collect and process data locally, more specifically where they were generated. OPERA aims at researching energy efficiency of such cloud end-nodes by designing an ultra-low power computing system with reconfigurable radio frequency capabilities. The effectiveness of the whole platform will be demonstrated with key scenarios, specifically a road traffic monitoring application, the deployment of a virtual desktop infrastructure, and the deployment of a small data center on a truck.","","978-1-5090-2817-7","10.1109/DSD.2016.63","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7723570","Cloud infrastructure;heterogeneity;FPGA;energy efficiency","Cloud computing;Program processors;Field programmable gate arrays;Servers;Hardware;Acceleration;Low-power electronics","","","2","24","IEEE","27 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In existing, reactive auto-scaling mechanism of pod resources is used to add or remove resources manually or rule based for handling static workloads from users and most of the times it may lead to over provision or under provisioning of instances that violates QOS and SLA. In this paper, predictive horizontal scaling of pods utilizing custom metrics with orchestration through Kuberenetes is proposed with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) based on Deep Learning (DL) technique. DL is data hungry for right prediction of replicas of a cluster that is needed in advance to run cyclic workloads and to handle the sudden spike of demand by using the cloud large dataset real time traces. Moreover, LSTM model is compared with GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) and experimental results shows that the results of LSTM prediction has less absolute error rate on comparing with GRU to keep the resource provisioning accuracy better for running the modern workloads seamlessly on public cloud.","","978-1-6654-9710-7","10.1109/ICAAIC53929.2022.9792749","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9792749","Container Virtu aliza tion;Pods;Predictive Scaling;Replicas;Agility;Elasticity;Cloud-native applications","Measurement;Cloud computing;Error analysis;Quality of service;Containers;Predictive models;Logic gates","","","","22","IEEE","16 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, existing simulators fail to integrate critical function modules of network feature extraction and visualization. While significant learning burden is inevitable but unbearable for users. In this paper, we propose a trajectory big data driven network simulator with interactive visualization for large-scale networking, feature extraction and data transmission. Our simulator consists of three key modules of trajectory data preprocessing, network feature extraction, and routing protocol evaluation. The integration of multiple function modules with intuitive performance visualization greatly enhances usage convenience. In particular, diverse social network features are available for users to achieve in-depth perception on practical networks and facilitate better design of realistic protocols. A novel social com-munity discovering algorithm dedicated for ocean vessel network is proposed as a supplement to land-based mobile networks. The developed simulator is extensively evaluated with a real dataset of vessel trajectories over East China Sea. Experimental results illustrate the feasible functions, step-by-step visualization, and convenient interfaces.","2155-6814","978-1-6654-7180-0","10.1109/MASS56207.2022.00024","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1707700); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41976185,61902367); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9973601","network simulator;trajectory big data;network feature extraction;interactive visualization","Visualization;Social networking (online);Data preprocessing;Data visualization;Big Data;Feature extraction;Data models","","","","36","IEEE","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The arrival rates usually exceed service rates despite Ethernet TCP windowing and layer-3 fair queuing. This is unacceptable in Osmotic computing paradigm which houses machine to machine cloud elasticity especially for IoT plug and play edge devices. This research proposes Fog and server consolidation (SC) in distributed high performance data centers (D-HPDCs) as a middleware solution to solve the problem. A candidate scheme called green virtualization is used to share the capabilities of physical servers (bare metals) by splitting resources among operating systems that host an on-demand smart grid application. AType-I virtual machine hypervisor is used to mitigate the various pitfalls in legacy datacenters (DCs) such as resource availability, query response time, scalability and network quality of service (QoS). MATLAB SimEvent simulation is used to realize a case-based Branch-and-Bound heuristics as an optimization scheme in the green virtualized DC. Within the elasticity zone, performance evaluation between Type-I virtualized and non-virtualized DC is carried out. The benefits of virtualized DCs using cloud elasticity design framework is highlighted. The results showed that the Type-1 virtualized DC scenario had better QoS performance metrics compared with the non-virtualized DC. Consequently, SC using virtualization is shown to be efficient for supporting multi-constrained DC environments.","2377-2697","978-1-5090-6422-9","10.1109/NIGERCON.2017.8281912","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8281912","Cloud Visualization;Large Scale Data centers;Discrete Event Simulation;Optimization;Heuristics","Cloud computing;Elasticity;Servers;Virtualization;Virtual machine monitors;Quality of service;Data centers","","","","25","IEEE","8 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Especially in such architectures that feature interacting microservices, performance degradation from a subset of resource-starved microservices could rapidly spread to other microservices creating additional performance hotspots and increasing tail latencies in inter-microservice communication - directly impacting deterministic execution of the overall cloud application. Optimizing resource allocation is one way to address this problem, and it has received some research attention. Specifically, two categories of approaches have been explored: a) correction after detection of performance bottlenecks, and b) predictive identification and correction of upcoming bottlenecks. This paper focuses on CPU support for deterministic cloud computing for either of these approaches, and also on identification of better operational points upfront. It highlights the benefits of using CPU hardware-based approaches through real-world benchmarks and explores an active learning approach to identify operational points enabling static and semi-static pre-configuration of resources. We present measurements from industry benchmark applications to demonstrate benefits of this CPU-based approach and illustrate effectiveness of our proposed preconfiguration method through a simulator featuring configurable number of microservices and inter-connectivity.","","978-1-7281-8266-7","10.1109/IEEECloudSummit48914.2020.00012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9283675","Cloud computing;microservices;determinism;Resource Director Technology;RDT;Intel® Xeon®","Industries;Degradation;Cloud computing;Scalability;Computer architecture;Benchmark testing;Resource management","","","","17","IEEE","15 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional centralised social networking analytics and metrics can estimate the expected number of customers using well-established vendor-specific revenue assurance tools. They include a systematic approach of incorporating social, environmental, economic, and other values into standard decision-making processes. The challenge appears when the decentralised social media stakeholders come into the game. Then they need to find unified metrics to measure the achievement of social impact relying on three primary performance indicators: appropriateness, efficiency and effectiveness. This paper presents the idea of adding social collaboration term to increase impact within the industry and the effectiveness of tactics and strategies among multiple people, groups or departments. The decision making process related to the revenues will thus benefit from this newly defined metric called Return on Collaboration (ROC). Measuring the ROC provides users with real-time cost per engagement analyses, allowing them to define their specific business application success indicators. The traditional ROI calculates the gain or loss of a given investment. On the other hand, ROC measures the ""improvement"" resulting from a monetary expenditure in collaboration and the innovative ROC model facilitates user collaboration and revenue growth. As a result, providers can assess the effect of social media services and technologies.","","978-1-6654-4930-4","10.1109/ISMSIT52890.2021.9604730","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9604730","Return on Collaboration;Return on Investment;Social Media;Data Analytic","Measurement;Systematics;Social networking (online);Decision making;Collaboration;Tools;Real-time systems","","","","29","IEEE","19 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because the application function of the service platform is modular, it can accurately grasp the service content of different management operators, provide different reading services for different readers, and achieve humanized intelligent services. However, because the applicable functional services are composed of small modules, the connectivity between the functions is poor. When processing a large amount of reading information, the response time of reading services is increased, so that the reader's borrowing operation time is prolonged.
