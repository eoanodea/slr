While the problem has been faced with centralized approaches assuming knowledge of the available underlying infrastructure resources, this paper introduces a distributed task allocation framework emphasizing energy awareness without requiring infrastructure knowledge. The framework is designed to optimize energy consumption in heterogeneous computing environments, leveraging a distributed consensus algorithm that allows nodes to maximize individual or global goals. Each private custom utility function enables a node to carefully determine whether executing a task is efficient, thus ensuring flexibility in the task allocation process based on local preferences. While showcasing the energy efficiency of our framework, we also illustrate that it is not necessary to disclose the underlying infrastructure resources status, ensuring the preservation of potentially sensitive local resources information. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's ability to achieve optimal power consumption outcomes while maintaining privacy, offering a significant advancement over traditional centralized allocation policies and Kubernetes-like scheduling algorithms.","2024","2025-03-18 09:11:58","2025-03-18 09:11:58","","28–34","","","","","","","MECC '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Athens, Greece","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study proposes harnessing micro-frontend technologies to surmount the limitations of monolithic front-end frameworks, thereby crafting effective presentation layers tailored for industrial companies. By decomposing complex and distributed systems into modular web-based DT, the proposed framework enables better scalability, synergy, and efficient application development. It also tackles the intricacies introduced by complex multi-vendor elements within DT and the orchestration of services and virtual environments. Research is focused on developing an architecture that facilitates seamless connectivity between multiple blocks of DT as well as interactivity and immersive experiences. Our study offers insights into our journey of implementing this framework for various industrial use cases, such as training, monitoring, and control, highlighting the benefits, drawbacks, and challenges.

In this work, we introduce a possible framework for software energy costs evaluation based on model analysis. We model software as Labelled Transitions Systems (LTS) and annotate these models with energy costs, which can be obtained using existing tools. We can then apply graph-based algorithms to traverse the models to obtain information about energy consumption related to software behaviour, such as its most/least costly execution, the cost of a specific execution, and the average cost of executing the software. No existing tool currently provides all the necessary analyses, even though they are essential for energy-consumption evaluation. We have conducted a small experiment with our framework where we employed jRAPL to measure energy costs. We annotated the models with the collected energy costs using an extended version of the LoTuS tool, where we have also implemented some of the desired analyses.

To reduce energy-related costs and improve environmental sustainability, most modern data centers consolidate Virtual Machine (VM) workloads belonging to different application classes, some being latency-critical (LC) and others being more tolerant to performance changes, known as best-effort (BE). However, in public cloud scenarios, the real classes of applications are often opaque to data center operators. The heterogeneous applications from different cloud tenants are usually consolidated onto the same hosts to improve energy efficiency, but it is not trivial to guarantee decent performance isolation among colocated workloads. We tackle the above challenges by introducing Demeter, a QoS-aware power management controller for heterogeneous black-box workloads in public clouds. Demeter is designed to work without offline profiling or prior knowledge about black-box workloads. Through the correlation analysis between network throughput and CPU resource utilization, Demeter automatically classifies black-box workloads as either LC or BE. By provisioning differentiated CPU management strategies (including dynamic core allocation and frequency scaling) to LC and BE workloads, Demeter achieves considerable power savings together with a minimum impact on the performance of all workloads. We discuss the design and implementation of Demeter in this work, and conduct extensive experimental evaluations to reveal its effectiveness. Our results show that Demeter not only meets the performance demand of all workloads, but also responds quickly to dynamic load changes in our cloud environment. In addition, Demeter saves an average of 10.6% power consumption than state of the art mechanisms.","2022","2025-03-18 09:11:58","2025-03-18 09:11:58","","31–46","","","","","","","SoCC '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: San Francisco, California","","","","cloud computing; power management; quality of service; workload characterization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While the former offer greater control over distributed application components, the latter offers frugal network negotiations, no system-wide crashes, privacy, among others.This work focuses on identifying ""ideal"" host candidates for microservices' execution in a decentralized network, applying run-time scheduling operations (migration or duplication) to reduce energy consumption. To do this, we created a scheduling algorithm using MAAN (a P2P approach) to interpret a decentralized network as a multidimensional resource (capacity-demand) space, which supports range queries in a logarithmic quantity of hops. In this way, a node that runs a set of microservices is able to 1) map them in terms of their execution requirements (i.e. CPU frequency, RAM capacity, Network rate and disk speed) 2) Select an ideal microservice to be moved or duplicated, 3) find ideal node(s) that meet all those requirements in an optimal computational complexity and 4) negotiate the movement or duplication of the selected microservice, by analyzing energy consumption and QoS criteria.","2021","2025-03-18 09:11:58","2025-03-18 09:11:58","","69–78","","","","","","","SAC '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, Republic of Korea","","","","cloud computing; microservices; power consumption; energy consumption; distributed algorithms; P2P","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the interest of programmer productivity and ease of scaling, workloads in data centers have shifted from single monolithic processes toward a micro and nanoservice software architecture. As a result, single servers are now packed with many threads executing the same, relatively small task on different data.State-of-the-art data centers run these microservices on multi-core CPUs. However, the flexibility offered by traditional CPUs comes at an energy-efficiency cost. The Multiple Instruction Multiple Data execution model misses opportunities to aggregate the similarity in contemporary microservices. We observe that the Single Instruction Multiple Thread execution model, employed by GPUs, provides better thread scaling and has the potential to reduce frontend and memory system energy consumption. However, contemporary GPUs are ill-suited for the latency-sensitive microservice space.To exploit the similarity in contemporary microservices, while maintaining acceptable latency, we propose the Request Processing Unit (RPU). The RPU combines elements of out-of-order CPUs with lockstep thread aggregation mechanisms found in GPUs to execute microservices in a Single Instruction Multiple Request (SIMR) fashion. To complement the RPU, we also propose a SIMR-aware software stack that uses novel mechanisms to batch requests based on their predicted control-flow, split batches based on predicted latency divergence and map per-request memory allocations to maximize coalescing opportunities.

To facilitate such optimizations, we present Carbon Containers, a simple system-level facility, which extends prior work on power containers, that automatically regulates applications' carbon emissions in response to variations in both their work-load's intensity and their energy's carbon-intensity. Specifically, Carbon Containers enable applications to specify a maximum carbon emissions rate (in g.CO2e/hr), and then transparently enforce this rate via a combination of vertical scaling, container migration, and suspend/resume while maximizing either energy-efficiency or performance.Carbon Containers are especially useful for applications that i) must continue running even during high-carbon periods, and ii) execute in regions with few variations in carbon-intensity. These low-variability regions also tend to have high average carbon-intensity, which increases the importance of regulating carbon emissions. We implement a Carbon Container prototype by extending Linux Containers to incorporate the mechanisms above and evaluate it using real workload traces and carbon-intensity data from multiple regions.

To achieve this, ANT-Man abstracts away two major sources of latency overhead in traditional hierarchical power management frameworks. First, ANT-Man proposes an auto power budgeting scheme for reducing the power coordination latency at the datacenter level. It can proactively determine the power budget tailored to each individual microservice. Second, ANT-Man proposes a native and transparent power control scheme to overcome the power configuration latency for each microservice. It enables super-fast power budget enforcement with nanosecond-scale performance scaling.

Their wide resource distribution enables MECs to fulfill the need of low latency and high bandwidth to offer an improved user experience.As modern cloud applications are increasingly architected as collections of small, independently deployable services, they can be flexibly deployed in various configurations that combines resources from both centralized datacenters and edge locations. In principle, such applications should therefore be well-placed to exploit the advantages of MECs so as to reduce service response times.In this paper, we quantify the benefits of deploying such cloud micro-service applications on MECs. Using two popular benchmarks, we show that, against conventional wisdom, end-to-end latency does not improve significantly even when most application services are deployed in the edge location. We developed a profiler to better understand this phenomenon, allowing us to develop recommendations for adapting applications to MECs. Further, by quantifying the gains of those recommendations, we show that the performance of an application can be made to reach the ideal scenario, in which the latency between an edge datacenter and a remote datacenter has no impact on the application performance.This work thus presents ways of adapting cloud-native applications to take advantage of MECs and provides guidance for developing MEC-native applications. We believe that both these elements are necessary to drive MEC adoption.","2019","2025-03-18 09:11:58","2025-03-18 09:11:58","","250–263","","","","","","","SEC '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Arlington, Virginia","","","","edge latency; micro-service; mobile application development; mobile edge clouds; profiling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While traditionally top-down, microservices align with IoT's need for flexible, vendor-independent service combinations. Identifying challenges in traditional IoT architectures, this research addresses a gap in the lack of a comprehensive review on the integration of microservices.

Its role in DSO is critical in providing feedback loops on system performance leading to desirable changes achieving long-term system and application sustainment. Containers are the de-facto deployed artifacts in DSO for diverse forms of systems and applications including AI models. Long-term sustainment of containerized AI models requires appropriate metrics for the successful maintenance of optimal container and model computing performance and correct model inference. There is no agreed upon set of metrics that should always be present when monitoring a deployed containerized AI model. The current literature and practice can benefit from a standard baseline of metrics for long-term monitoring of containerized AI models focused on computing and inference. In this paper, we propose a candidate baseline of metrics for consideration as a standard across PDM for any containerized AI model. We present a proof-of-concept (PoC) that implements a baseline of metrics for the continuous monitoring of an operationally deployed containerized AI model. The baseline represents the minimal metrics required for any containerized model deployed and actively operating to ensure successful long-term monitoring and support of optimal operation and performance. The metrics focus on container operation, model operation, and model inference. This paper also details the raw data required for the metrics along with a PoC which demonstrates container engineering for their acquisition. The paper illustrates the baseline as a mix of dynamic metrics that are customized for each problem class (e.g., object detection, regression) and data modality together with static metrics that should be present for any containerized model. The paper further shows that a containerized AI model can be engineered to produce these metrics and describes the benefits of a standardized baseline of metrics to aid in the reduction of power consumption in the global digital enterprise.","2024","2025-03-18 09:11:58","2025-03-18 09:11:58","","46–55","","","","","","","ICSSP '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: M\, Germany","","","","AI; Artificial Intelligence; Container; Continuous Deployment; Deployment; DevOps; DevSecOps.; Machine Learning; Metrics; ML; Performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite accelerating microservice diversity, there is a strong requirement to limit diversity in underlying server hardware to maintain hardware resource fungibility, preserve procurement economies of scale, and curb qualification/test overheads. As such, there is an urgent need for strategies that enable limited server CPU architectures (a.k.a ""SKUs"") to provide performance and energy efficiency over diverse microservices. To this end, we first undertake a comprehensive characterization of the top seven microservices that run on the compute-optimized data center fleet at Facebook.Our characterization reveals profound diversity in OS and I/O interaction, cache misses, memory bandwidth utilization, instruction mix, and CPU stall behavior. Whereas customizing a CPU SKU for each microservice might be beneficial, it is prohibitive. Instead, we argue for ""soft SKUs"", wherein we exploit coarse-grain (e.g., boot time) configuration knobs to tune the platform for a particular microservice. We develop a tool, μSKU, that automates search over a soft-SKU design space using A/B testing in production and demonstrate how it can obtain statistically significant gains (up to 7.2% and 4.5% performance improvement over stock and production servers, respectively) with no additional hardware requirements.","2019","2025-03-18 09:11:58","2025-03-18 09:11:58","","513–526","","","","","","","ISCA '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Phoenix, Arizona","","","","microservice; resource fungibility; soft SKU","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing CPU power-saving techniques degrade the performance of these applications due to the long transition latency (order of 100μs) to wake up from a deep CPU idle state (C-state). For this reason, server vendors recommend only enabling shallow core C-states (e.g., CC1) for idle CPU cores, thus preventing the system from entering deep package C-states (e.g., PC6) when all CPU cores are idle. This choice, however, impairs server energy proportionality since power-hungry resources (e.g., IOs, uncore, DRAM) remain active even when there is no active core to use them. As we show, it is common for all cores to be idle due to the low average utilization (e.g., 5 – 20%) of datacenter servers running user-facing applications.We propose to reap this opportunity with AgilePkgC (APC), a new package C-state architecture that improves the energy proportionality of server processors running latency-critical applications. APC implements PC1A (package C1 agile), a new deep package C-state that a system can enter once all cores are in a shallow C-state (i.e., CC1) and has a nanosecond-scale transition latency. PC1A is based on four key techniques. First, a hardware-based agile power management unit (APMU) rapidly detects when all cores enter a shallow core C-state (CC1) and triggers the system-level power savings control flow. Second, an IO Standby Mode (IOSM) places IO interfaces (e.g., PCIe, DMI, UPI, DRAM) in shallow (nanosecond-scale transition latency) low-power modes. Third, a CLM Retention (CLMR) mode rapidly reduces the CLM (Cache-and-home-agent, Last-level-cache, and Mesh network-on-chip) domain's voltage to its retention level, drastically reducing its power consumption. Fourth, APC keeps all system PLLs active in PC1A to allow nanosecond-scale exit latency by avoiding PLL re-locking overhead.Combining these techniques enables significant power savings while requiring less than 200ns transition latency, &gt;250× faster than existing deep package C-states (e.g., PC6), making PC1A practical for datacenter servers. Our evaluation based on an Intel Skylake-based server shows that APC reduces the energy consumption of Memcached by up to 41% (25% on average) with &lt;0.1% performance degradation. APC provides similar benefits for other representative workloads.","2023","2025-03-18 09:11:58","2025-03-18 09:11:58","","851–867","","","","","","","MICRO '22","","","","IEEE Press","Chicago, Illinois, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ultimately, these limitations complicate the maintenance and evolution of microservice-based applications. In this paper, we propose a rethinking of service composition and present Knactor, a new data-centric composition framework to restore the modularity that microservices were intended to offer.

It proves through experimental methods that the containerized deployment and elastic scaling configuration methods of cloud platforms can effectively improve the operation efficiency of cloud resources. The application method has also been promoted and verified in many different regions across the country, further proving that it can effectively help enterprises improve resource efficiency and reduce operating costs, and provide a reference for large-scale application of elastic scaling configuration in large enterprises.","2024","2025-03-18 09:11:58","2025-03-18 09:11:58","","944–951","","","","","","","ICCSIE '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","Kubernetes; Cloud platform; Digital grid; Elastic scaling; Resource scheduling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed approach is evaluated in two real-world scenarios and one fictional case, illustrating its practical application in optimizing operations and ensuring scalability, security, and performance. While AI demonstrates transformative potential in aiding architectural practices, we also highlight its limitations, emphasizing the importance of human oversight in validating technical assumptions and avoiding over-reliance on automated tools.

Finding well suited granularities in terms of the architectural capabilities of endpoints and the read-write semantics of their operations are particularly important design concerns. Existing pattern languages have dealt with local APIs in object-oriented programming, with remote objects, with queue-based messaging and with service-oriented computing platforms. However, patterns or equivalent guidances for the architectural design of API endpoints, operations and their request and response message structures are still missing. In this paper, we extend our microservice API pattern language (MAP) and introduce endpoint role and operation responsibility patterns, namely Processing Resource, Computation Function, State Creation Operation, Retrieval Operation, and State Transition Operation.

Essential design goals for Selena are both extensibility, so that many different data sources and providers (e.g., measurement systems) can be integrated easily, as well as efficient scalability, so that the system can be used from small (e.g., one building) to large installations (potentially entire neighborhoods) with deployment cost commensurate with the installation size.

This disrupts the remote Cloud Computing model, moving applications, data and computing resources to the logical extremes of the network. Thus, to handle streaming data in IoT environments, an efficient IoT-based computing model that can dynamically handle the interplay between Cloud and Edge data centers is required. In this direction, a recent paradigm, popularly known as Osmotic Computing, has emerged to ensure the acceptable performance of widely dispersed services. However, the burden of data-offloading across multiple data centers usually leads to a consequent increase in their energy consumption which in-turn will affect the overall Quality of Service (QoS) of the IoT-based applications. Keeping focus on all these issues, a consolidated decision making framework for Osmotic Computing, i.e., En-OsCo, is designed to ensure the energy-aware dynamic management of resources. The proposed framework incorporates four significant contributions: i) Resource monitoring of Edge data centers using Extended Kalman Filter, ii) Optimal dispatch of incoming services to the Edge/Cloud setup using Hyper-heuristics, iii) Minimizing the energy consumption of underlying data centers and reducing the service latency, and iv) Reducing the search space of Hyper-heuristics by keeping track of previously made decisions using Universal Streaming Monitoring. Further, in order to validate the efficacy of the proposed En-OsCo framework, ContainerCloudSim has been used in combination of HyFlex on PlanetLab datasets. The obtained results validate the purpose of the proposed scheme in minimizing the overall energy consumption of the computing setup while considerably reducing the latency.","2019","2025-03-18 09:11:58","2025-03-18 09:11:58","","19–24","","","","","","","PERSIST-IoT '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Catania, Italy","","","","Cloud Computing; Edge Computing; and Osmotic Computing; Energy Minimization; Extended Kalman Filter; Hyper-heuristics; Latency Minimization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We develop a tool called MeshInsight to help developers quantify the overhead of service meshes in deployment scenarios of interest and make informed trade-offs about their functionality vs. overhead. Using MeshInsight, we confirm that service meshes can have high overhead—up to 269% higher latency and up to 163% more virtual CPU cores for our benchmark applications—but the severity is intimately tied to how they are configured and the application workload. IPC (inter-process communication) and socket writes dominate when the service mesh operates as a TCP proxy, but protocol parsing dominates when it operates as an HTTP proxy.

Compared with traditional operating systems, one of the fundamental requirements of UOS is to adaptively manage numerous heterogeneous sensors according to dynamic environments and diverse tasks. However, traditional management focuses on the sensors’ parameters and interfaces without highlighting the perception effect that is users’ concern and dynamic changing. It also lacks a unified management approach for heterogeneous sensors. To overcome the limitations, we propose a novel heterogeneous sensors dynamic management model UbiCap, i.e., Ubiquitous Capability, which is based on the capability abstraction and adaptive run-time capability management mechanism. The capability provides a unified abstract for heterogeneous sensors. The adaptive run-time capability management mechanism transfers the management object from low-level hardware sensors to high-level sensing capability. The capability required and the available capability are matched to support run-time adaptive sensors selection. We implement a software prototype iS2ROS(intelligent Sensor Selection Robot Operating System) based on the UbiCap model. We then simulate a forest fire spot monitoring scenario where iS2ROS selects the optimal image sensor during the identification task execution while light or weather condition changes. Experiment results show that the iS2ROS achieves comparative sensing effectiveness through UbiCap with 50% power consumption lower compared to the traditional both-sensors approach.","2023","2025-03-18 09:11:58","2025-03-18 09:11:58","","134–143","","","","","","","Internetware '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Hangzhou, China","","","","adaptive; Capability; Heterogeneous Sensors Management; run-time; Ubiquitous Operating System","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These characteristics render existing energy-conserving techniques ineffective when processors are idle due to the long transition time (order of 100μs) from a deep CPU core idle power state (C-state). While prior works propose management techniques to mitigate this inefficiency, we tackle it at its root with AgileWatts (AW): a new deep CPU core C-state architecture optimized for datacenter server processors targeting latency-sensitive applications.AW drastically reduces the transition latency from deep CPU core idle power states while retaining most of their power savings based on three key ideas. First, AW eliminates the latency (several microseconds) of saving/restoring the core context when powering-off/-on the core in a deep idle state by i) implementing medium-grained power-gates, carefully distributed across the CPU core, and ii) retaining context in the power-ungated domain. Second, AW eliminates the flush latency (several tens of microseconds) of the L1/L2 caches when entering a deep idle state by keeping L1/L2 content power-ungated. A small control logic also remains ungated to serve cache coherence traffic. AW implements cache sleep-mode and leakage reduction for the power-ungated domain by lowering a core's voltage to the minimum operational level. Third, using a state-of-the-art power efficient all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) clock generator, AW keeps the PLL active and locked during the idle state, cutting microseconds of wake-up latency at negligible power cost.Our evaluation with an accurate industrial-grade simulator calibrated against an Intel Skylake server shows that AW reduces the energy consumption of Memcached by up to 71% (35% on average) with &lt;1% end-to-end performance degradation. We observe similar trends for other evaluated services (MySQL and Kafka). AW's new deep C-states C6A and C6AE reduce transition-time by up to 900× as compared to the deepest existing idle state C6, while consuming only 7% and 5% of the active state (C0) power, respectively.","2023","2025-03-18 09:11:58","2025-03-18 09:11:58","","835–850","","","","","","","MICRO '22","","","","IEEE Press","Chicago, Illinois, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of them is simulators.

Although traditional data center power optimization frameworks excel at per-server or per-rack management, they can hardly make informed decisions when facing microservices that have different QoS requirements on a per-service basis. In a power-constrained data center, blindly budgeting power usage could lead to a power unbalance issue: microservices on the critical path may not receive adequate power budget. This unavoidably hinders the growth of cloud productivity.To unleash the performance potential of cloud in the microservice era, this paper investigates microservice-aware data center resource management. We model microservice using a bipartite graph and propose a metric called microservice criticality factor (MCF) to measure the overall impact of performance scaling on a microservice from the whole application's perspective. We further devise ServiceFridge, a novel system framework that leverages MCF to jointly orchestrate software containers and control hardware power demand. Our detailed case study on a practical microservice application demonstrates that ServiceFridge allows data center to reduce its dynamic power by 25% with slight performance loss. It improves the mean response time by 25.2% and improves the 90th tail latency by 18.0% compared with existing schemes.","2019","2025-03-18 09:11:58","2025-03-18 09:11:58","","","","","","","","","ICPP '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Kyoto, Japan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Power is one of the most constrained and difficult to manage resources in datacenters. Accurate accounting of power usage across clients of multi-tenant web services can improve budgeting, planning and provisioning of compute resources. In this work, we propose a queuing theory based transitive power modeling framework that estimates the total power cost of a client request across the stack of shared services running in Facebook datacenters. By capturing the non-linearity of power vs load relation, our model is able to estimate marginal change in power consumption of a system upon serving a request with a mean error of less than 4% when applied on production services. In view of the fact that datacenter capacity is planned for peak demand, we test this model at peak load to report up to 2x improvement in accuracy compared to a mathematical model. We further leverage this framework along with a distributed tracing system to estimate power demand shift for serving particular product features within fraction of a percentage and guide the decision to shift their computation at off-peak time.","2021","2025-03-18 09:11:58","2025-03-18 09:11:58","","182–191","","","","","","","WWW '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Ljubljana, Slovenia","","","","cpu; power; scalability; time shifting; transitive; utilization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A vast majority of these microservices typically span less than a second, have strict SLO requirements, and are chained together as per the requirements of an application. The aforementioned characteristics introduce a new set of challenges, especially in terms of container provisioning and management, as the state-of-the-art resource management frameworks, employed in serverless platforms, tend to look at microservice-based applications similar to conventional monolithic applications. Hence, these frameworks suffer from microservice agnostic scheduling and colossal container over-provisioning, especially during workload fluctuations, thereby resulting in poor resource utilization.In this work, we quantify the above shortcomings using a variety of workloads on a multi-node cluster managed by the Kubernetes and Brigade serverless framework. To address them, we propose Fifer — an adaptive resource management framework to efficiently manage function-chains on serverless platforms. The key idea is to make Fifer (i) utilization conscious by efficiently bin packing jobs to fewer containers using function-aware container scaling and intelligent request batching, and (ii) at the same time, SLO-compliant by proactively spawning containers to avoid cold-starts, thus minimizing the overall response latency. Combining these benefits, Fifer improves container utilization and cluster-wide energy consumption by 4× and 31%, respectively, without compromising on SLO's, when compared to the state-of-the-art schedulers employed by serverless platforms.","2020","2025-03-18 09:11:58","2025-03-18 09:11:58","","280–295","","","","","","","Middleware '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Delft, Netherlands","","","","scheduling; serverless; resource-management; queuing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Various intelligent sensors play a central role, as they generate a vast amount of real-time data that can provide insights into manufacturing. Complex event processing (CEP) and machine learning (ML) have been developed actively in the last years in IIoT to identify patterns in heterogeneous data streams and fuse raw data into tangible facts. In a traditional compute-centric paradigm, the raw field data are continuously sent to the cloud and processed centrally. As IIoT devices become increasingly pervasive, concerns are raised since transmitting such an amount of data is energy-intensive, vulnerable to be intercepted, and subjected to high latency. Decentralized on-device ML and CEP provide a solution where data is processed primarily on edge devices. Thus communications can be minimized. However, this is no mean feat because most IIoT edge devices are resource-constrained with low power consumption. This paper proposes a framework that exploits ML and CEP's synergy at the edge in distributed sensor networks. By leveraging tiny ML and μCEP, we now shift the computation from the cloud to the resource-constrained IIoT devices and allow users to adapt on-device ML models and CEP reasoning rules flexibly on the fly. Lastly, we demonstrate the proposed solution and show its effectiveness and feasibility using an industrial use case of machine safety monitoring.","2021","2025-03-18 09:11:58","2025-03-18 09:11:58","","126–135","","","","","","","DEBS '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, Italy","","","","industrial IoT; complex event processing; tiny machine learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the significant progress of recent efforts in analyzing the security effectiveness of MTD mechanisms, critical gaps still exist in terms of the impact of running MTD mechanisms on system performance and dependability, exposing a critical design tradeoff between security and performance. To investigate the tradeoff, we propose performability models for evaluating services hosted in software-defined networks with a time-based MTD mechanism being deployed. We developed analytical models for evaluating key performability metrics, in terms of response time, throughput, availability, host utilization, a number of requests lost, and cost (i.e., energy consumption plus profits lost due to dropped jobs). Our results showed that using the time-based MTD mechanism can (1) improve service response time and host utilization; (2) introduce a higher number of requests lost and higher overall cost; and (3) reduce service availability while still handling most of the jobs without much performance degradation.","2020","2025-03-18 09:11:58","2025-03-18 09:11:58","","1180–1189","","","","","","","SAC '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Brno, Czech Republic","","","","moving target defense; performability; petri nets; software-defined networking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Polling has lower latency but each CPU core can only run one thread. Interrupt enables time sharing among multiple threads but has higher latency. Many applications such as databases have hundreds of threads, which is much larger than the number of cores. So, they have to use interrupt mode to share cores among threads, and the resulting RDMA latency is much higher than the hardware limits. In this paper, we analyze the root cause of high costs in RDMA interrupt delivery, and present FastWake, a practical redesign of interrupt-mode RDMA host network stack using commodity RDMA hardware, Linux OS, and unmodified applications. Our first approach to fast thread wake-up completely removes interrupts. We design a per-core dispatcher thread to poll all the completion queues of the application threads on the same core, and utilize a kernel fast path to context switch to the thread with an incoming completion event. The approach above would keep CPUs running at 100% utilization, so we design an interrupt-based approach for scenarios with power constraints. Observing that waking up a thread on the same core as the interrupt is much faster than threads on other cores, we dynamically adjust RDMA event queue mappings to improve interrupt core affinity. In addition, we revisit the kernel path of thread wake-up, and remove the overheads in virtual file system (VFS), locking, and process scheduling. Experiments show that FastWake can reduce RDMA latency by 80% on x86 and 77% on ARM at the cost of &lt; 30% higher power utilization than traditional interrupts, and the latency is only 0.3 ∼ 0.4&nbsp;μ s higher than the limits of underlying hardware. When power saving is desired, our interrupt-based approach can still reduce interrupt-mode RDMA latency by 59% on x86 and 52% on ARM.","2023","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","1–7","","","","","","","APNet '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Hong Kong, China","","","","Context Switch; Host Network Stack; Interrupt; RDMA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that the capabilities of even decade-old smartphones are within those demanded by modern cloud microservices and discuss how to combine phones to perform increasingly complex tasks. We describe how current operation-focused metrics do not capture the actual carbon costs of compute. We propose Computational Carbon Intensity—a performance metric that balances the continued service of older devices with the superlinear runtime improvements of newer machines. We use this metric to redefine device service lifetime in terms of carbon efficiency. We develop a cloudlet of reused Pixel 3A phones.

They deliver greater connectivity, tremendous savings, and lower total cost of ownership. Despite such benefits and benchmarking advances, costs are still quite unpredictable, performance is unclear, security is inconsistent, and there is minimal control over aspects like data and service locality. Estimating performance of cloud environments is very hard for cloud consumers. They would like to make informed decisions about which provider better suits their needs using specialized evaluation mechanisms. Providers have their own tools reporting specific metrics, but they are potentially biased and often incomparable across providers. Current benchmarking tools allow comparison but consumers need more flexibility to evaluate environments under actual operating conditions for specialized applications. Ours is early stage work and a step towards a monitoring solution that enables independent evaluation of clouds for very specific application needs. In this paper, we present our initial architecture of the Cloud Monitor that aims to integrate existing and new benchmarks in a flexible and extensible way. By way of a simplistic demonstrator, we illustrate the concept. We report some preliminary monitoring results after a brief time of monitoring and are able to observe unexpected anomalies.

In this paper we highlight the architectural weakness of a centralized controller in O-RAN by first drawing parallels with the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) controller. We then present a two part security evaluation of two open-source Near-RT RICs (μONOS and OSC), focused on the newly introduced A1 interface of the Near-RT RIC. In the first part of our evaluation, we evaluate the supply-chain risks of μONOS and OSC using off-the-shelf open-source dependency analysis and configuration file analysis tools. In the second part, we present our run-time security testing of the A1 API implemented by μONOS and OSC using our custom O-RAN A1 Interface Testing Tool (OAITT). Our supply-chain risk analysis shows that both the open-source Near-RT RICs we evaluated have multiple dependency risks and weak or insecure configurations. We identified 211 and 285 known dependency vulnerabilities in μONOS and OSC respectively of which 82 and 190 dependencies were rated as high CVSS respectively. The A1 interface contributed to a majority of the dependency risks in both Near-RT RICs. From a security misconfiguration perspective, we identified issues concerning access control, lack of encryption and poor secret management. Our run-time testing of OSC and μONOS revealed the following. First, both Near-RT RICs lack TLS for the A1 interface. Second, malicious Non-Real Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Non-RT RIC)s or rApps that reside in the Non-RT RIC could tamper with policies installed in the Near-RT RIC which can impact the availability of the O-RAN. Third, the A1 protocol could be exploited by Non-RT RICs for covert communication via the Near-RT RIC. Fourth, the A1 implementation by μONOS was vulnerable to degradation of service attacks (10-60s response time for GET requests) and a denial of service attack, the latter has been ethically reported and a fix is underway.","2024","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","277–287","","","","","","","WiSec '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Seoul, Republic of Korea","","","","near-real time ric; o-ran; security testing; software security","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present paper, a new software solution for supporting the hybridizations of parallel EAs is proposed. Unlike other software solutions for hybridizing EAs, the proposed software solution provides a flexible, generic and scalable mechanism for integrating any algorithmic approach like a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm to seed the initial population of parallel EAs. It is designed based on three modern software technologies, namely microservices, container virtualization and the publish/subscribe messaging paradigm. The applicability and generality of the presented software solution is tested by hybridizing the General Learning Evolutionary Algorithm and Method (GLEAM) with ML techniques for solving the problem of scheduling Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). The benchmarking tests are performed in a cluster computing environment.

Real-time analysis of sonar data is crucial for time-sensitive applications, including environmental anomaly detection and in-season fishery management, where rapid decision-making is needed. However, the lack of both relevant datasets andpre-trained DNN models, coupled with resource limitations in wild environments, hinders the effective deployment and continuous operation of live sonar analytics.We present SALINA, a sustainable live sonar analytics system designed to address these challenges. SALINA enables real-time processing of acoustic sonar data with spatial and temporal adaptations, and features energy-efficient operation through a robust energy management module. Deployed for six months at two inland rivers in British Columbia, Canada, SALINA provided continuous 24/7 underwater monitoring, supporting fishery stewardship and wildlife restoration efforts. Through extensive real-world testing, SALINA demonstrated an up to 9.5% improvement in average precision and a 10.1% increase in tracking metrics. The energy management module successfully handled extreme weather, preventing outages and reducing contingency costs. These results offer valuable insights for long-term deployment of acoustic data systems in the wild.","2024","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","68–81","","","","","","","SenSys '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Hangzhou, China","","","","edge computing; sustainability; edge-cloud collaboration; internet of things; live analytics; sensing; solar power; sonar radar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Apart from the inherent performance differences between high and low power processors, porting a managed runtime system to a low-power architecture may result in spuriously introducing additional overheads and design trade-offs. In this work we investigate how the lack of strong hardware support for Self Modifying Code (SMC) in low-power architectures, influences Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and execution in modern virtual machines. In particular, we examine how low-power architectures, with no or limited hardware support for SMC, impose restrictions on call-site implementations, when the latter need to be patchable by the runtime system. We present four different memory-safe implementations for call-site generation and discuss their advantages and disadvantages in the absence of strong hardware support for SMC. Finally, we evaluate each technique on different workloads using micro-benchmarks and we evaluate the best two techniques on the Dacapo benchmark suite showcasing performance differences up to 15%.","2019","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","131–143","","","","","","","MPLR 2019","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Athens, Greece","","","","AArch64; JIT compilation; RISC; Self modifying code","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Modern interactive workloads such as geo-distributed web-services exhibit various spatiotemporal and performance flexibility, enabling the possibility to adapt the location, time, and intensity of processing to align with the availability of renewable and low-carbon energy. An example is a web application hosted across multiple cloud regions, each with varying carbon intensity based on their local electricity mix. Distributed load-balancing enables the exploitation of low-carbon energy through load migration across regions, reducing web applications carbon footprint. In this paper, we present CASPER, a carbon-aware scheduling and provisioning system that primarily minimizes the carbon footprint of distributed web services while also respecting their Service Level Objectives (SLO). We formulate CASPER as an multi-objective optimization problem that considers both the variable carbon intensity and latency constraints of the network. Our evaluation reveals the significant potential of CASPER in achieving substantial reductions in carbon emissions. Compared to baseline methods, CASPER demonstrates improvements of up to 70% with no latency performance degradation.","2024","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","67–73","","","","","","","IGSC '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Toronto, ON, Canada","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These can be broadly characterized into two groups: model-based and stateless. Model-based frameworks use machine learning to achieve good performance under a power budget but are highly dependent on the quality of the learned model and the data used to train it. Stateless frameworks are more robust and require no training, but are generally lower performance. In this paper, we propose a new framework that does not require a model, but does track a small amount of state in the form of recent power dynamics. We implement this idea and test it on a public cloud running both Spark and HPC jobs. We find when total power demand is low, our framework achieves equivalent performance to prior work, but when power demand is high it achieves mean 8% performance improvement (with no reliance on a learned model).","2023","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","","","","","","","","SC '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Denver, CO, USA","","","","resource management; job scheduling; power-efficient design and power-management strategies; system interoperations and energy-aware techniques for large-scale systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, in this work, we propose a deep-learning-based approach for identifying the presence of two containers colluding to covertly leak secret information. In more detail, we consider a threat actor trying to exfiltrate a 4,096-bit private TLS key via five different covert channels. To decide whether containers are colluding for leaking data, the deep learning model is fed with statistical indicators of the syscalls, which are built starting from simple counters.

Yet, the cloud computing sector, with its increasingly large carbon footprint, has initiated only modest efforts to reduce emissions to date; its main approach today relies on cloud providers sourcing renewable energy from a limited global pool of options. We investigate how to accelerate cloud computing's efforts. Our approach tackles carbon reduction from a software standpoint by gradually integrating carbon awareness into the cloud abstraction. Specifically, we identify key bottlenecks to software-driven cloud carbon reduction, including (1) the lack of visibility and disaggregated control between cloud providers and users over infrastructure and applications, (2) the immense overhead presently incurred by application developers to implement carbon-aware application optimizations, and (3) the increasing complexity of carbon-aware resource management due to renewable energy variability and growing hardware heterogeneity. To overcome these barriers, we propose an agile approach that federates the responsibility and tools to achieve carbon awareness across different cloud stakeholders. As a key first step, we advocate leveraging the role of application operators in managing large-scale cloud deployments and integrating carbon efficiency metrics into their cloud usage workflow. We discuss various techniques to help operators reduce carbon emissions, such as carbon budgets, service-level visibility into emissions, and configurable-yet-centralized resource management optimizations.","2023","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","","","","","","","","HotCarbon '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Boston, MA, USA","","","","cloud computing; sustainability; carbon reduction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"MY7JAUR3","book","2024","","ASPLOS '24: Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems, Volume 3","","979-8-4007-0386-7","","","","Welcome to the third volume of ASPLOS'24: the 29th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems. This document is mostly dedicated to the 2024 fall cycle but also provides some statistics summarizing all three cycles.We introduced several notable changes to ASPLOS this year, most of which were discussed in our previous messages from program chairs in Volume 1 and 2, including: (1) significantly increasing the program committee size to over 220 members (more than twice the size of last year); (2) foregoing synchronous program committee (PC) meetings and instead making all decisions online; (3) overhauling the review assignment process; (4) developing an automated submission format violation identifier script that uncovers, e.g., disallowed vertical space manipulations that ""squeeze"" space; (5) introducing the new ASPLOS role of Program Vice Chairs to cope with the increased number of submissions and the added load caused by foregoing synchronous program committee; and (6) characterizing a systematic problem that ASPLOS is facing in reviewing quantum computing submissions, describing how we addressed it and highlighting how we believe that it should be handled in the future.Assuming readers have read our previous messages, here, we will only describe differences between the current cycle and the previous ones. These include: (1) Finally unifying submission and acceptance paper formatting instructions (forgoing the `jpaper' class) to rid authors of accepted papers from the need to reformat; (2) Describing the methodology we employed to select best papers, which we believe ensures quality and hope will persist; and (3) Reporting the ethical incidents we encountered and how we handled them. In the final, fourth volume, when the outcome of the ASPLOS'24 fall major revisions will become known, we plan to conduct a broader analysis of all the data we have gathered throughout the year.Following are some key statistics of the fall cycle: 340 submissions were finalized (43% more than last year's fall count and 17% less than our summer cycle) of which 111 are related to accelerators/FPGAs/GPUs, 105 to machine learning, 54 to security, 50 to datacenter/cloud and 50 to storage/memory; 183 (54%) submissions were promoted to the second review round; 39 (11.5%) papers were accepted (of which 19 were awarded artifact evaluation badges); 33 (9.7%) submissions were allowed to submit major revisions and are currently under review (these will be addressed in the fourth volume of ASPLOS'24 and will be presented in ASPLOS'25 if accepted); 1,368 reviews were uploaded; and 4,949 comments were generated during online discussions, of which 4,070 were dedicated to the submissions that made it to the second review round.This year, in the submission form, we asked authors to specify which of the three ASPLOS research areas are related to their submitted work. Analyzing this data revealed that 80%, 39%, and 29% of the submissions are categorized by their authors as related to architecture, operating systems, and programming languages, respectively, generating the highest difference we have observed across the cycles between architecture and the other two. About 46% of the fall submissions are ""interdisciplinary,"" namely, were associated with two or more of the three areas.Overall, throughout all the ASPLOS'24 cycles, we received 922 submissions, constituting a 1.54x increase compared to last year. Our reviewers submitted a total of 3,634 reviews containing more than 2.6 million words, and we also generated 12,655 online comments consisting of nearly 1.2 million words. As planned, PC members submitted an average of 15.7 reviews and a median of 15, and external review committee (ERC) members submitted an average of 4.7 and a median of 5.We accepted 170 papers thus far, written by 1100 authors, leading to an 18.4% acceptance rate, with the aforementioned 33 major revisions still under review. Assuming that the revision acceptance rate will be similar to that of previous cycles, we estimate that ASPLOS'24 will accept nearly 200 (!) papers, namely, 21%–22% of the submissions.The ASPLOS'24 program consists of 193 papers: the 170 papers we accepted thus far and, in addition, 23 major revisions from the fall cycle of ASPLOS'23, which were re-reviewed and accepted. The full details are available in the PDF of the front matter.","2024","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","","","","3","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If users choose software, compute hardware and aircraft well, FAAS can complete missions faster and safer than unmanned aerial systems piloted by humans. On the other hand, poorly managed edge resources slow down missions, waste energy and inflate costs. This paper presents a model-driven approach to manage FAAS. We fly real FAAS missions, profile compute and aircraft resource usage and model expected demands. Naive profiling approaches use traces from previous flights to infer resource usage. However, edge resources can affect where FAAS fly and which data they sense. Usage profiles can diverge greatly across edge management policies. Instead of using traces, we characterize whole flight areas to accurately model resource usage for any flight path. We combine expected resource demands to model mission throughput, i.e., missions completed per fully charged battery. We validated our model by creating FAAS, measuring mission throughput across many system settings. Our FAAS benchmarks, released through our open source FAAS suite SoftwarePilot, execute realistic missions: autonomous photography, search and rescue, and agricultural scouting using well-known software. Our model predicted throughput with 4% error across mission, software and hardware settings. Competing approaches yielded 10–24% error. We used our SoftwarePilot benchmarks to study (1) GPU acceleration, scale up, and scale out, (2) onboard, edge and cloud computing, (3) energy and monetary budgets, and (4) software driven GPU management. We found that model-driven management can boost mission throughput by 10X and reduce costs by 87%.","2019","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","74–87","","","","","","","SEC '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Arlington, Virginia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To enable applications on mobile devices, the offloading approach processes live video streams using DNNs on server-class GPU accelerators. However, their use in latency constrained applications is particularly challenging because of the large and unpredictable round-trip latency from mobile devices to the cloud computing resources. As a consequence, system designers routinely look for ways to offload to local servers at the cloud edge, known as the cloudlet. This paper explores the potential of serving multiple DNNs using the cloudlet model to implement complex vision applications on mobile devices. We present DeepQuery, a new mobile offloading system that is capable to serve DNNs with different structures for a wide range of tasks including object detection and tracking, scene graph detection, and video description. DeepQuery provides application programming interfaces to offload applications programed as Directed Acyclic Graphs of DNN queries, and employs data parallelization and input batching techniques to reduce processing delays. To improve GPU utilization, it co-locates real-time and delay-tolerant tasks on shared GPUs, and exploits a predictive and plan-ahead approach to alleviate resource contention caused by co-locating. We evaluate DeepQuery and demonstrate its effectiveness using several real world applications.","2019","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","36–47","","","","","","","MMSys '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Amherst, Massachusetts","","","","cloud computing; edge computing; computer vision; deep neural networks; mobile computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For online services, short-term allocation can speed up targeted query executions and free up cache lines reserved, but normally not needed, for performance. However, in collocated settings, short-term allocation can increase cache contention, slowing down collocated query executions. To offset slowdowns, collocated services may request short-term allocation more often, making the problem worse. Short-term allocation policies manage which queries receive cache allocations and when. In collocated settings, these policies should balance targeted query speedups against slowdowns caused by recurring cache contention. We present a model-driven approach that (1) predicts response time under a given policy, (2) explores competing policies and (3) chooses policies that yield low response time for all collocated services. Our approach profiles cache usage offline, characterizes the effects of cache allocation policies using deep learning techniques and devises novel performance models for short-term allocation with online services. We tested our approach using data processing, cloud, and high-performance computing benchmarks collocated on Intel processors equipped with Cache Allocation Technology.

Although a number of direct control-based demand response solutions exist and have been successfully deployed and demonstrated in the real world, they are typically designed for, and are effective only at small scale and/or target specific types of loads, leading to relatively high cost-of-entry. This prohibits deploying scalable solutions.The H2020 GOFLEX project has addressed this issue and developed a scalable, general, and replicable so-called GOFLEX system, which offers a market-driven approach to solve congestion problems in distribution grids based on aggregated individual flexibilities from a wide range of prosumers, both small (incl. electric vehicles, heat-pumps, boilers, freezers, fridges) and large (incl. factories, water pumping stations, etc.). By encompassing individual prosumers, aggregators, distribution system operators, and energy multi-utilities and retailers. It is a system of systems, where all flexibilities in electricity demand, production, and storage are extracted, (dis)aggregated, optimized, and traded using the powerful and standardized FlexOffer format, yielding a general and replicable solution with low cost-of-entry. The system has been successfully deployed in Switzerland, Germany, and Cyprus where it has controlled loads of 500+ prosumers, with a total of 800MWh flexibility offered on the market, offering up to 64% of adaptability in peak demand. In this paper, we present the overall architecture of the GOFLEX system, its sub-systems, and the interaction between these sub-systems.

They are able to request a service with different implementations of the same functionality, including hardware accelerator, depending on cost and performance. This model opens up a new opportunity to integrate reconfigurable hardware, specifically, FPGA, in the cloud to offer such services. There are many research works discussing solutions for this problem but they focus primarily on the high-level aspects of resource manager, hypervisor or hardware architecture. The low-level physical design choices of FPGA to maximize the accelerator allocation success rate (called serviceability) is largely untouched. In this paper, we propose a design space exploration algorithm to determine the best configuration of partially reconfigurable regions (PRRs) to host the accelerators. Besides, the algorithm is capable of estimating the actual resources occupied by the PRRs on the FPGA even before floorplanning. We systematically study the effects of having more PRRs on the system in various aspects, i.e., serviceability, waiting time and resource wastage. The experiments show that at a certain number of PRRs, upto 91% serviceability can be achieved for 12 concurrent users. It is a significant improvement from 52% without our approach. The average amount of time that each request has to wait to be served is also reduced by 6.3X. Furthermore, the cumulative unused FPGA resources is reduced almost by half.","2020","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","29–39","","","","","","","FPGA '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Seaside, CA, USA","","","","cloud; microservice; design automation; design space exploration; floorplan; fpga; partial reconfiguration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, the upgrading and optimization of the distribution network is the key to the success of the modern energy revolution, and the development of the distribution network is also faced with management and technical challenges brought by new equipment and resources. This article proposes a distribution network data resource integration and fusion method that takes into account new energy, integrating the constantly emerging new power equipment and facilities as well as their corresponding data resources into existing power information management systems. Using the integrated distribution network data platform as the data base to support the deepening and development of distribution network business applications. Firstly, the data description characteristics of the new power equipment and facilities are sorted out, and the description rule system is extracted using the methods of power equivalence processing and equipment profiling. Due to the lack of standardized description rules for new energy equipment, it is necessary to reorganize and construct a corresponding description rule system. Then map and correspond its description rules with existing power information description rules, find its mapping method, and build a mapping rule library. Finally, based on the mapping rule library, the fusion of new energy data and existing distribution network data resources is achieved, and the accuracy and applicability of data resource fusion are verified by selecting real data from business application scenarios.","2024","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","630–635","","","","","","","ICITEE '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Changde, Hunan, China","","","","Application validation; Data mapping rules; Data resource integration; Distribution network; New energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, existing platforms suffer from limited portability and interoperability, resulting in redundant efforts and inefficient resource and energy utilization due to vendor and even platform lock-in. To bridge the aforementioned gaps, the Graph-Massivizer project, funded by the Horizon Europe research and innovation program, conducts research and develops a high-performance, scalable, and sustainable platform for information processing and reasoning based on the massive graph (MG) representation of extreme data.

In addition to the direct overhead of long VM set-up/destruction times, we demonstrate by experimentation the indirect costs on real world auto scaling systems. Focusing on the popular Xen hypervisor, we identify three critical issues hindering the scalability of the boot and destruction processes: serialized boot, unscalable interactions with the Xenstore at guest creation time, and remote NUMA memory scrubbing at destruction time. For each of these issues we present the design and implementation of a solution in the Xen infrastructure: parallel boot with fine-grained locking, caching of Xenstore data, and local NUMA scrubbing. We evaluate these solutions using micro-benchmarks, macro-benchmarks, and real world datacenter traces. Results show that our work improves the current Xen implementation by a significant factor, for example macro-benchmarks indicate a speedup of more than 4X in high-load scenarios.","2017","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","1–14","","","","","","","VEE '17","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Xi'an, China","","","","Cloud Computing; Elasticity; Scalability; Virtualization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such applications are deployed on specially designed Edge Sensor Nodes (ESNs) that possess various sensors and limited computing power and support multiple data analysis tasks. ESNs encounter unique operational challenges, including intermittent power supplies, limited connectivity, and dynamic application and resource requirements, which complicate runtime management. Conventional resource management platforms like Kubernetes and KubeEdge are unsuitable for the dynamic needs of ESNs due to their reliance on centralized control and expected stable conditions. To bridge this gap, our paper introduces a data-driven resource management framework tailored for the autonomous adaptation of ESNs to diverse application and infrastructure requirements. We propose an intent-based mechanism that aligns application requirements, such as end-to-end latency, with infrastructure goals like utilization levels. This mechanism translates high-level intents into actionable low-level configurations, balancing the competing demands of various applications and resources, thereby guiding us toward a more robust and efficient application management system. We have implemented a prototype system, evaluated it on an experimental testbed, and demonstrated that our approach performs better than static-only optimization approaches with minimal impact on application performance.","2024","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","1–8","","","","","","","FlexScience'24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Pisa, Italy","","","","edge computing; automated application management; environmental monitoring applications; intent-driven resource management; internet of things (IoT)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With increase in the availability of data, 'Modeling &amp; Simulation' systems are becoming ubiquitous.

In this paper, we define a set of five pipelines inspired by microservices-oriented architecture. Four modular pipeline templates are defined, Data Processing Pipeline, Modeling and Simulation Pipeline, Validation Pipeline, Visual Analytics Pipeline; each encapsulating details of important tasks in modern-day complex systems. In addition, one custom pipeline is developed, for composing tasks that can be executed concurrently, called Parallelizable Pipeline. We instantiate this pipeline architecture for designing a synthetic energy demand modeling system. The value of the pipeline is demonstrated via three case studies - two of these studies provide new insights into issues related to equity and climate change impact.","2023","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","855–866","","","","","","","WSC '22","","","","IEEE Press","Singapore, Singapore","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the same time, low-latency video analytics is becoming more and more important for applications in public safety, counter-terrorism, self-driving cars, VR/AR, etc. As those tasks are either computation intensive or bandwidth hungry, edge computing fits in well here with its ability to flexibly utilize computation and bandwidth from and between each layer. In this paper, we present LAVEA, a system built on top of an edge computing platform, which offloads computation between clients and edge nodes, collaborates nearby edge nodes, to provide low-latency video analytics at places closer to the users. We have utilized an edge-first design and formulated an optimization problem for offloading task selection and prioritized offloading requests received at the edge node to minimize the response time. In case of a saturating workload on the front edge node, we have designed and compared various task placement schemes that are tailed for inter-edge collaboration. We have implemented and evaluated our system. Our results reveal that the client-edge configuration has a speedup ranging from 1.3x to 4x (1.2x to 1.7x) against running in local (client-cloud configuration). The proposed shortest scheduling latency first scheme outputs the best overall task placement performance for inter-edge collaboration.","2017","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","","","","","","","","SEC '17","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: San Jose, California","","","","edge computing; computation offloading","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As data gathered from the Edge has to be transferred to the Cloud in order to be processed, the result will be a decreased responsiveness of the system. Also, devices might have to process data by themselves, as the Cloud could be unreachable at random moments in time, resulting in a reduction in battery life. Therefore, we propose an architecture that solves these problems, by introducing an intermediate layer, called Fog, which uses a task scheduling algorithm to send data received from Edge to another device that has enough resources and the required hardware and software to complete the task. In addition, the architecture is based on microservices, hence improving scalability and flexibility. In the performance analysis, we used different values to find the best node that should receive the data for processing. In addition, we compared the microservice based architecture with a monolithic one in order to see how the throughput and responsiveness of the system are affected.","2020","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","1264–1271","","","","","","","SAC '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Brno, Czech Republic","","","","cloud computing; task scheduling; edge computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel blockchain-based architecture that leverages Software Defined Network (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) for securing IoT transactions. A novel security appliance is introduced in a form of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) for improving the scalability and performance of IoT networks.

Software in CPS applications ranges from small systems to large systems, aka. Systems of Systems (SoS), such as smart grids and cities. CPSoS require managing massive amounts of data, being aware of their emerging behavior, and scaling out to progressively evolve and add new systems. Cloud computing supports processing and storing massive amounts of data, hosting and delivering services, and configuring self-provisioned resources. Therefore, cloud computing is the natural candidate to solve CPSoS needs. However, the diversity of platforms and the low-level cloud programming models make difficult to find a common solution for the development and deployment of CPSoS. This paper presents the architectural foundations of a cloud-centric framework for automating the development and deployment of CPSoS service applications to converge towards a common open service platform for CPSoS applications.

In particular, with the proposal of the goal of ""carbon peak, carbon neutrality"" and the gradual implementation of the construction of new power systems, a large number of distributed photovoltaic, electric vehicles, energy storage, and other new source loads are connected to the power distribution area in a large-scale manner. The demand for intelligent interaction between the distribution network and users is gradually emerging and growing. The construction of digitally intelligent Internet of Things power distribution area has become a consensus and an inevitable trend. In order to promote and implement the construction of digital intelligent IoT stations, it is necessary to carry out simulation construction of low-voltage intelligent IoT stations, simulate and build real application scenarios, in order to better carry out research and exploration verification of the application of key technologies such as intelligent IoT in distribution stations. Thus providing technical support and guidance for the implementation of the new power system construction at the low-voltage substation level. This article, based on project experience, focuses on the verification methods and environmental design ideas for three typical application functions of low-voltage topology identification, fault location analysis, and power quality analysis of the intelligent integration terminal in the power distribution area, in order to provide a reference for the simulation design of low-voltage intelligent IoT power distribution area.","2024","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","261–266","","","","","","","AIBDF '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Guangzhou, China","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The vast majority of these applications are user-facing, and hence, have stringent SLO requirements. Serverless functions, having short resource provisioning times and instant scalability, are suitable candidates for developing such latency-critical applications. However, existing serverless providers are unaware of the workflow characteristics of application DAGs, leading to container over-provisioning in many cases. This is further exacerbated in the case of dynamic DAGs, where the function chain for an application is not known a priori. Motivated by these observations, we propose Kraken, a workflow-aware resource management framework that minimizes the number of containers provisioned for an application DAG while ensuring SLO-compliance. We design and implement Kraken on OpenFaaS and evaluate it on a multi-node Kubernetes-managed cluster. Our extensive experimental evaluation using DeathStarbench workload suite and real-world traces demonstrates that Kraken spawns up to 76% fewer containers, thereby improving container utilization and saving cluster-wide energy by up to 4x and 48%, respectively, when compared to state-of-the art schedulers employed in serverless platforms.","2021","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","153–167","","","","","","","SoCC '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Seattle, WA, USA","","","","scheduling; serverless; resource-management; queuing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, the resulting insights about the current air quality need to be actively queried by the citizens, leading to situations in which the citizen is exposed to a high air pollution without being aware of it. In this article, we introduce a context-aware air pollution monitoring and alert service that proactively notifies citizens via mobile devices about highly relevant air quality information once they enter an area with an air pollution that exceeds a user-defined threshold. The service continuously determines the concentration of particulate matter throughout a given urban area, detects closed areas with a high air pollution and shares this information with the citizen's mobile devices which are in turn responsible to regularly compare a citizen's position against the areas of poor air quality. As a proof of concept, we prototypically implemented and evaluated the service by means of real world measurements taken on consecutive days within an urban area in New Zealand.","2018","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","","","","","","","","IOT '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Santa Barbara, California, USA","","","","air quality; context-aware computing; geofencing; location-based services; smart city; urban sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to its resounding success, serverless is rapidly emerging as a powerful paradigm in edge computing as well, wherein computing resources are geographically distributed in proximity to users. In serverless edge systems, applications can be composed by two types of microservice instances. Remote-state instances are internally stateless and access a remote state, if needed. On the other hand, a local-state instance is dedicated to a user and locally retains state information. In this work, we focus on live migration of local-state instances across an edge system operated by Kubernetes, which is the de-facto standard for microservice automated orchestration. More specifically, we propose a solution able to migrate both single-container and multi-container instances between different Kubernetes clusters. Our approach leverages the Liqo open-source project to establish a peering relationship and transfer the instance state between the involved clusters. After presenting the design and proof-of-concept implementation of the proposed solution, we outline useful insights into how to deploy it in practice and describe the experiments carried out to validate our work.

This modular approach segments the 5G Core Network into discrete, functionally autonomous Network Functions (NFs), deployed via either virtual machines or container technologies. The efficacy of the SBA execution platform significantly impacts the service capabilities of these NFs. In this study, we present an enhanced architecture that employs extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) and eXpress Data Path (XDP) technologies to fine-tune the network, security, service, and scheduling aspects within a Kubernetes framework. Additionally, eBPF’s monitoring and packet control features augment the service capabilities of 5G components, thereby improving encrypted data transmission. eBPF’s real-time monitoring aids the scheduler in making nuanced decisions, while an eBPF-driven load balancer ensures equitable service distribution. Comprehensive testing reveals that the enhanced architecture increases transmission efficiency by 17%, reduces average latency by 43%, and alleviates latency anomalies compared to conventional 5G NF platforms. It also enhances the inherent connectivity of 5G NFs by approximately 15%. For encryption-reliant applications, the architecture achieves a 17% performance gain in latency, transmission, and connectivity, while its scheduling and service balancing capabilities demonstrate a roughly 19% performance enhancement.","2024","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","200–209","","","","","","","ICNCC '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Osaka, Japan","","","","5G Core Network; eBPF/XDP; Virtual Network Acceleration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper takes a self-developed industrial Internet application as an example to deeply explore the path through which the industrial Internet empowers the digital transformation of SMEs. This application embraces a new digital transformation empowerment framework for SMEs that this paper proposes. This framework comprehensively presents the approaches to empower the digital transformation of SMEs from the aspects of empowerment strategy, service capability, collaboration scenarios, and technical architecture. Through cases in multiple comprehensive scenarios, this paper validates the effectiveness of this framework and the digital application developed based on it.","2024","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","9–17","","","","","","","IOTMMIM '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Hangzhou, China","","","","Digital Transformation; Industrial Internet; Small and Medium Enterprises; SMEs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Deploying functions is mutually profitable: users need not be concerned with resource management, while providers can keep their servers at high utilization rates running thousands of functions concurrently on a single machine. It is exactly this high concurrency that comes at a cost. The standard Linux Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) switches often between tasks, which leads to prolonged execution times. We present evidence that relying on the default Linux CFS scheduler increases serverless workloads cost by up to 10×.In this article, we raise awareness and make a case for rethinking the OS-level scheduling in Linux for serverless workloads composed of many short-lived processes. To make serverless more affordable we introduce a hybrid two-level scheduling approach that relies on FaaS characteristics. Short-running functions are executed in FIFO fashion without preemption, while longer-running functions are passed to CFS after a certain time period. We show that tailor-made OS scheduling is able to significantly reduce user-facing costs without adding any provider-facing overhead.","2024","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","172–184","","","","","","","Middleware '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Hong Kong, Hong Kong","","","","FaaS; serverless computing; cost for serverless; CPU scheduling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show how to leverage a decentralized authorization syndication platform to extend the design of building operating systems beyond the single administrative domain of a building. The authorization system leveraged is based on blockchain smart contracts to permit decentralized and democratized delegation of authorization without central trust. Upon this, a publish/subscribe syndication tier and a containerized service execution environment are constructed. Combined, these mechanisms solve problems of delegation, federation, device protection and service execution that arise throughout the built environment. We leverage a high-fidelity city-scale emulation to verify the scalability of the authorization tier, and briefly describe a prototypical democratized operating system for the built environment using this foundation.","2017","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","","","","","","","","BuildSys '17","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Delft, Netherlands","","","","microservices; federation; syndication; built environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ambition is to detect the vulnerabilities in the whole software supply chain and to support developers holding security as a key component over the Software Development life-cycle. We design reliable tools by building a semantic graph-based abstraction of the code from the compiler state, and we reach high accuracy by developing different static code analyzers optimizing the detection of software vulnerabilities in the source code and dependencies. In this paper, we will introduce the cybersecurity suite composed of different vulnerability detection tools to promote developer autonomy and security automation over the software supply chain. The main tool (DocSpot) detects vulnerabilities in the application source code and leverages knowledge graph technology. The second tool (DocDocker) scans for vulnerabilities in containers, and the third one (SirDocker) detects orchestration vulnerabilities, e.g. related to configuration, recommends secure best practices, and supports secure management of the containers and container images.

While ML techniques enable dealing with several problems in self-adaptation, such as scalable decision-making, they are also subject to inherent challenges. In this paper, we focus on one such challenge that is particularly important for self-adaptation: ML techniques are designed to deal with a set of predefined tasks associated with an operational domain; they have problems to deal with new emerging tasks, such as concept shift in input data that is used for learning. To tackle this challenge, we present lifelong self-adaptation: a novel approach to self-adaptation that enhances self-adaptive systems that use ML techniques with a lifelong ML layer. The lifelong ML layer tracks the running system and its environment, associates this knowledge with the current tasks, identifies new tasks based on differentiations, and updates the learning models of the self-adaptive system accordingly. We present a reusable architecture for lifelong self-adaptation and apply it to the case of concept drift caused by unforeseen changes of the input data of a learning model that is used for decision-making in self-adaptation. We validate lifelong self-adaptation for two types of concept drift using two cases.","2022","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","1–12","","","","","","","SEAMS '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The majority of these apps process user-provided input to produce the desired results. Existing work in the area of input-sensitive profiling has empirically shown that many such apps have input size-dependent execution times which can be determined through modelling techniques. Nevertheless, existing serverless resource management frameworks are agnostic to the input size-sensitive nature of these apps. We demonstrate in this paper that this can potentially lead to container over-provisioning and/or end-to-end Service Level Objective (SLO) violations. To address this, we propose Cypress, an input size-sensitive resource management framework, that minimizes the containers provisioned for apps, while ensuring a high degree of SLO compliance. We perform an extensive evaluation of Cypress on top of a Kubernetes-managed cluster using 5 apps from the AWS Serverless Application Repository and/or Open-FaaS Function Store with real-world traces and varied input size distributions. Our experimental results show that Cypress spawns up to 66% fewer containers, thereby, improving container utilization and saving cluster-wide energy by up to 2.95X and 23%, respectively, versus state-of-the-art frameworks, while remaining highly SLO-compliant (up to 99.99%).","2022","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","257–272","","","","","","","SoCC '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: San Francisco, California","","","","scheduling; serverless; input size; resource-management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Efficient RCA can greatly accelerate system failure recovery and mitigate system damages or financial losses. However, previous research has mostly focused on developing offline RCA algorithms, which often require manually initiating the RCA process, a significant amount of time and data to train a robust model, and then being retrained from scratch for a new system fault.In this paper, we propose CORAL, a novel online RCA framework that can automatically trigger the RCA process and incrementally update the RCA model. CORAL consists of Trigger Point Detection, Incremental Disentangled Causal Graph Learning, and Network Propagation-based Root Cause Localization. The Trigger Point Detection component aims to detect system state transitions automatically and in near-real-time. To achieve this, we develop an online trigger point detection approach based on multivariate singular spectrum analysis and cumulative sum statistics. To efficiently update the RCA model, we propose an incremental disentangled causal graph learning approach to decouple the state-invariant and state-dependent information. After that, CORAL applies a random walk with restarts to the updated causal graph to accurately identify root causes. The online RCA process terminates when the causal graph and the generated root cause list converge. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework.","2023","2025-03-18 09:11:59","2025-03-18 09:11:59","","2269–2278","","","","","","","KDD '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Long Beach, CA, USA","","","","causal structure learning; disentangled graph learning; incremental learning; root cause analysis; trigger point detection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The design follows a cloud-first, data-driven methodology underpinned by principles derived from analyzing the archival workload of a large public cloud service. Silica can support a wide range of archival storage workloads and ushers in a new era of sustainable, cost-effective storage.","2023","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","166–181","","","","","","","SOSP '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Koblenz, Germany","","","","data center; sustainability; archival; cloud storage; cold storage; disaggregation; glass; storage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, they usually treat an LC workload as a whole when allocating resources to BE jobs and neglect the different features of components of an LC workload. This kind of coarse-grained co-location method leaves a significant room for improvement in resource utilization.Based on the observation of the inconsistent interference tolerance abilities of different LC components, we propose a new abstraction called Servpod, which is a collection of a LC parts that are deployed on the same physical machine together, and show its merits on building a fine-grained co-location framework. The key idea is to differentiate the BE throughput launched with each LC Servpod, i.e., Servpod with high interference tolerance ability can be deployed along with more BE jobs. Based on Servpods, we present Rhythm, a co-location controller that maximizes the resource utilization while guaranteeing LC service's tail latency requirement. It quantifies the interference tolerance ability of each servpod through the analysis of tail-latency contribution. We evaluate Rhythm using LC services in forms of containerized processes and microservices, and find that it can improve the system throughput by 31.7%, CPU utilization by 26.2%, and memory bandwidth utilization by 34% while guaranteeing the SLA (service level agreement).","2020","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","","","","","","","","EuroSys '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Heraklion, Greece","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One technique for analyzing complex IT systems relies on emulation, where the final software system is fully deployed on real architectures, and is evaluated in considering ""small"" instances of situations the system is supposed to solve. We propose a software architecture for studying the ecosystem of 'smart buildings'. This software architecture is built: 1) on top of ontologies for the description of smart buildings; 2) on a special tool for mastering the life cycle of data produced by sensors and actuators inside the buildings.We assume that it is equally important to model both the building's components and the flow of data produced inside the building. We use existing software components for both goals and to make real our concerns. According to a translational methodology, we also discuss use cases for illustrating the potential of our approach and the particular challenges associated with making the two main components of our emulation tool inter-operate.Therefore, our main contribution is to propose a comprehensive, ambitious and realistic research plan to guide communities. The paper illustrates how computer scientists and smart buildings domain scientists may communicate to address and solve specific research problems related to Big Data in emergent distributed environments. We are also guessing that experimental results that can demonstrate the practicality of the proposed combination of tools could be devised in the future, based on our broad vision.

These lightweight virtual machines (VMs) specialized to a single application offer the same level of isolation as full-blown VMs, while providing performance superior to standard Linux-based VMs or even to containers. However, their inherent specialization renders memory deduplication ineffective, causing unikernels, in practice, to consume more memory than their small memory footprint would suggest. This makes them less advantageous when thousands of SaaS and/or FaaS unikernels instances have to run on the same server.In this paper we introduce a novel approach to build the next generation of networked services and lambda functions by improving unikernel's memory layout so that it is more likely to share identical pages with other unikernels deployed on the system. Our approach supports SaaS and FaaS architectures and can be used with ASLR. Our experiments show that our approach can reduce the amount of physical memory used by a set of unikernels running on the same server by as much as 3x, with next to no overhead on applications performance.","2022","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","510–525","","","","","","","SoCC '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: San Francisco, California","","","","virtualization; virtual machine; alignment; deduplication; hypervisor; memory; operating systems; unikernels","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Each of these three trends individually provide significant benefits; however, when combined the benefits diminish. On the convergence of these trends, the paper makes the observation that for serverless functions, the overhead of accessing dissaggregated storage overshadows the gains from accelerators. Therefore, to benefit from all these trends in conjunction, we propose In-Storage Domain-Specific Acceleration for Serverless Computing (dubbed DSCS-Serverless1). The idea contributes a server-less model that utilizes a programmable accelerator embedded within computational storage to unlock the potential of acceleration in disaggregated datacenters. Our results with eight applications show that integrating a comparatively small accelerator within the storage (DSCS-Serverless) that fits within the storage's power constraints (25 Watts), significantly outperforms a traditional disaggregated system that utilizes NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti GPU (250 Watts). Further, the work highlights that disaggregation, serverless model, and the limited power budget for computation in storage device require a different design than the conventional practices of integrating microprocessors and FPGAs. This insight is in contrast with current practices of designing computational storage devices that are yet to address the challenges associated with the shifts in datacenters. In comparison with two such conventional designs that use ARM cores or a Xilinx FPGA, DSCS-Serverless provides 3.7× and 1.7× end-to-end application speedup, 4.3× and 1.9× energy reduction, and 3.2× and 2.3× better cost efficiency, respectively.","2024","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","530–548","","","","","","","ASPLOS '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: La Jolla, CA, USA","","","","serverless computing; accelerator; computational storage drive (CSD); deep neural network (DNN); disaggregated datacenter; domain specific architecture (DSA); in-storage acceleration; large language model (LLM); neural processing unit (NPU); serverless function; storage systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although there have been a significant amount of research efforts devoted in optimizing mobile offloading frameworks, most previous works are evaluated in a single-tenant setting, that is, a server is assigned to a single client. However, in a practical scenario that servers must handle tasks from many clients running diverse applications, contention on shared server resources may degrade application performance. In this work, we study scheduling techniques to improve serving performance in multi-tenant mobile offloading systems, for computer vision algorithms running on CPUs and deep neural networks (DNNs) running on GPUs. For CPU workloads, we present methods to mitigate resource contention and to improve delay using a Plan-Schedule approach. The planning phase predicts future workloads from all clients, estimates contention, and adjusts future task start times to remove or reduce contention. The scheduling phase dispatches arriving offloaded tasks to the server that minimizes contention. For DNN workloads running on GPUs, we propose adaptive batching algorithms using information of batch size, model complexity and system load to achieve the best Quality of Service (QoS), which are measured from accuracy and delay of DNN tasks. We demonstrate the improvement of serving performance using several real-world applications with different server deployments.","2019","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","21–30","","","","","","","ICDCN '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Bangalore, India","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The mobile IoT paradigm has been significantly expanded with the proliferation of drones and unmanned robotic devices. End-to-end communication and edge decision support are major challenges when operating with mobile nodes and especially with drones. In this paper, we propose a framework that uses two decision making stochastic optimization models of on-line control unit applied on transmission functionalities of mobile and static nodes adaptive to changes in network quality statistics. This is driven by a novel dynamic suppression control of telemetry process and control messages based on the principles of the Optimal Stopping Theory (OST). MOTIVE's time-optimized control mechanism ensures the optimal delivery of critical information from unmanned vehicles to ground control station and vice versa. The main goal, through this proposal, is to significantly enhance the operation of unmanned vehicles when operating under saturated, high traffic wireless networks.","2021","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","53–62","","","","","","","MobiWac '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Alicante, Spain","","","","apache kafka; change detection; message distributed platform; optimal stopping theory; queue prioritization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The advent of deep learning and the pursuit of artificial intelligence has created previously unfathomable deployments both in the datacenter and in the wild, enabling use-cases ranging from virtual reality and intelligent assistants to robots and self-driving cars. However, be it in the form of training or inference, these workloads pose several challenges pushing the compute, memory, sensing and networking capabilities of devices. As such, ML deployments become innately distributed, as a means to scale out local capabilities by leveraging remote or ambient resources in a distributed fashion in a collaborative manner. Simultaneously, the strive for user-privacy and sustainability gives birth to new training solutions, such as Federated Learning. However, adversarial actors may pose challenges to the robustness of the such deployments.Be it deployed in the cloud, edge or consumer end, Distributed ML challenges and pushes the limits of today's compute, networking and algorithmic frontier. To this end, the DistributedML workshop comes in a timely manner to provide a forum for ideas coming from different disciplines to be aired so as to solve current challenges and shape the technology of the future.","2022","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One enabler of such applications is the remote procedure call (RPC), which provides location-independent communication and hides the myriad of cloud communication complexities and requirements within the RPC stack. Understanding RPCs is thus one key to understanding the behavior of cloud applications. While there have been numerous studies of RPCs in distributed systems, as well as attempts to optimize RPC overheads with both software and hardware, there is still a lack of knowledge about the characteristics of RPCs ""in the wild"" in the modern cloud environment.To address this gap, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first large-scale fleet-wide study of RPCs. Our study is conducted at Google, where we measured the infrastructure supporting Google's user-facing, billion-user web services, such as Google Search, Gmail, Maps, and YouTube, and the information and data management systems that support them. To carry out the study, we examined over 10,000 different RPC methods sampled from over one billion traces, along with statistics collected every 30 minutes over a period of nearly two years. Among other things, we consider the volume, throughput and growth rate of RPCs in the datacenter, the latency of RPCs and their components (the ""RPC latency tax""), and the structure of RPC call chains. Our analysis shows that the characteristics, scope and complexity of RPCs at hyperscale differ significantly from the assumptions made in prior research. Overall, our work provides new insights into RPC usage and characteristics at the largest scale and motivates further research on optimizing the diverse behavior of this crucial communication mechanism.","2023","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","498–514","","","","","","","SOSP '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Koblenz, Germany","","","","cloud computing; distributed computing; communications systems; remote procedure call","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this sense, this paper investigates the use of Machine Learning algorithms to predict acceptable behaviour in system performance of a new software release. By monitoring the real performance, eventual unexpected problems can be identified. Based on previous knowledge and actual run-time information, the proposed approach predicts the response time that can be considered acceptable for the new software release, and this information is used to identify problematic releases. The mechanism has been applied to the post-deployment monitoring of traffic algorithms in elevator systems. To evaluate the approach, we have used performance mutation testing, obtaining good results. This paper makes two contributions. First, it proposes several regression learners that have been trained with different types of traffic profiles to efficiently predict response time of the traffic dispatching algorithm. This prediction is then compared with the actual response time of the new algorithm release, and provides a verdict about its performance. Secondly, a comparison of the different learners is performed.","2021","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","135–144","","","","","","","SAC '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, Republic of Korea","","","","machine learning; cyber-physical systems; performance bugs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it remains challenging to carry the well-trained deep models for online real-time inference serving, with respect to the time-varying web-scale traffics from billions of users, in a cost-effective manner. In this work, we present JIZHI - a Model-as-a-Service system - that per second handles hundreds of millions of online inference requests to huge deep models with more than trillions of sparse parameters, for over twenty real-time recommendation services at Baidu, Inc. In JIZHI, the inference workflow of every recommendation request is transformed to a Staged Event-Driven Pipeline (SEDP), where each node in the pipeline refers to a staged computation or I/O intensive task processor. With traffics of real-time inference requests arrived, each modularized processor can be run in a fully asynchronized way and managed separately. Besides, JIZHI introduces the heterogeneous and hierarchical storage to further accelerate the online inference process by reducing unnecessary computations and potential data access latency induced by ultra-sparse model parameters. Moreover, an intelligent resource manager has been deployed to maximize the throughput of JIZHI over the shared infrastructure by searching the optimal resource allocation plan from historical logs and fine-tuning the load shedding policies over intermediate system feedback. Extensive experiments have been done to demonstrate the advantages of JIZHI from the perspectives of end-to-end service latency, system-wide throughput, and resource consumption. Since launched in July 2019, JIZHI has helped Baidu saved more than ten million US dollars in hardware and utility costs per year while handling 200% more traffics without sacrificing the inference efficiency.","2021","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","3289–3298","","","","","","","KDD '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, Singapore","","","","intelligent resource management; MLOPS; online inference; recommendation system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of domain-specific languages for example, leads to the creation of numerous code generators that automatically translate highlevel system specifications into multi-target executable code. Producing correct and efficient code generator is complex and error-prone. Although software designers provide generally high-level test suites to verify the functional outcome of generated code, it remains challenging and tedious to verify the behavior of produced code in terms of non-functional properties. This paper describes a practical approach based on a runtime monitoring infrastructure to automatically check the potential inefficient code generators. This infrastructure, based on system containers as execution platforms, allows code-generator developers to evaluate the generated code performance. We evaluate our approach by analyzing the performance of Haxe, a popular high-level programming language that involves a set of cross-platform code generators.

Modern software data planes bypass OS I/O stacks and rely on cores spinning on user-level queues as a fast notification mechanism. Whereas spin-polling can improve latency and throughput, it entails significant shortcomings, especially when scaling to large numbers of cores/queues. In this paper, we pinpoint and quantify challenges of spin-polling–based software data planes using Intel's Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) as a representative infrastructure. We characterize four scalability issues of software data planes: (1) Full-tilt spinning cores perform more (useless) polling work when there is less work pending in the queues; (2) Spin-polling scales poorly with the number of polled queues due to processor cache capacity constraints, especially when traffic is unbalanced; (3) Operation rate limits (transactions per second) as well as a Polling Tax (the overhead of polling, which is considerable even when operating at saturation throughput) result in poor core scalability. (4) Whereas shared queues can mitigate load imbalance and head-of-line-blocking, synchronization overheads limit their potential benefits. We identify root causes of these issues and discuss solution directions to improve hardware and software abstractions for better performance, efficiency, and scalability in software data planes.","2019","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","337–350","","","","","","","SoCC '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Santa Cruz, CA, USA","","","","data planes; spin-polling; user-level queues","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous work suggested the use of controllers based on control theory or machine learning to reduce performance degradation under constrained power. However, generating these controllers is challenging as every web service applications running in a data center requires a power-performance model and a fine-tuned controller. In this paper, we present DDPC, a system for autonomic data-driven controller generation for power-latency management. DDPC automates the process of designing and deploying controllers for dynamic power allocation to manage the power-performance trade-offs for latency-sensitive web applications such as a social network. For each application, DDPC uses system identification techniques to learn an adaptive power-performance model that captures the application’s power-latency trade-offs which is then used to generate and deploy a Proportional-Integral (PI) power controller with gain-scheduling to dynamically manage the power allocation to the server running application using RAPL. We evaluate DDPC with two realistic latency-sensitive web applications under varying load scenarios. Our results show that DDPC is capable of autonomically generating and deploying controllers within a few minutes reducing the active power allocation of a web-server by more than 50% compared to state-of-the-art techniques while maintaining the latency well below the target of the application.","2023","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","3067–3076","","","","","","","WWW '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Austin, TX, USA","","","","datacenter; power-management; Web service performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The design of such systems bears high risk due to uncertainty in requirements related to service function and behavior, operation environments, and evolving customer needs. Such risks and uncertainties are well known in the IT sector, where DevOps principles ensure continuous system improvement through reliable and frequent delivery processes. A modular and service-oriented system architecture complements these processes to facilitate IT system adaptation and evolution.Objective: This work proposes a method to use and extend the Digital Twins (DTs) of IPSS assets for enabling the continuous optimization of CPS service delivery and the latter's adaptation to changing needs and environments. This reduces uncertainty during design and operations by assuring IPSS integrity and availability, especially for design and service adaptations at CPS runtime.Methodology: The method builds on transferring IT DevOps principles to DT-enabled CPS IPSS. The chosen design approach integrates, reuses, and aligns the DT processing and communication resources with DevOps requirements derived from literature.Results: We use these requirements to propose a DT-enabled self-adaptive CPS model, which guides the realization of DT-enabled DevOps in CPS IPSS. We further propose detailed design models for operation-critical DTs that integrate CPS closed-loop control and architecture-based CPS adaptation. This integrated approach enables the implementation of A/B testing as a use case and central concept to enable CPS IPSS service adaptation and reconfiguration.Conclusion: The self-adaptive CPS model and DT design concept have been validated in an evaluation environment for operation-critical CPS IPSS. The demonstrator achieved sub-millisecond cycle times during service A/B testing at runtime without causing CPS operation interferences and downtime.","2022","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","132–143","","","","","","","SEAMS '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","","","","self-adaptation; DevOps; CPS; digital twin; deployment; IPSS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Software Performance Antipatterns (SPAs) research has focused on algorithms for the characterization, detection, and solution of antipatterns. However, existing algorithms are based on the analysis of runtime behavior to detect trends on several monitored variables (e.g., response time, CPU utilization, and number of threads) using pre-defined thresholds. Objective. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for SPA characterization and detection designed to support continuous integration/delivery/deployment (CI/CDD) pipelines, with the goal of addressing the lack of computationally efficient algorithms.Method. Our approach includes SPA statistical characterization using a multivariate analysis approach of load testing experimental results to identify the services that have the largest impact on system scalability.More specifically, we introduce a layered decomposition approach that implements statistical analysis based on response time to characterize load testing experimental results. A distance function is used to match experimental results to SPAs.Results. We have instantiated the introduced methodology by applying it to a large complex telecom system. We were able to automatically identify the top five services that are scalability choke points. In addition, we were able to automatically identify one SPA. We have validated the engineering aspects of our methodology and the expected benefits by means of a domain experts' survey.Conclusion. We contribute to the state-of-the-art by introducing a novel approach to support computationally efficient SPA characterization and detection in large complex systems using performance testing results. We have compared the computational efficiency of the proposed approach with state-of-the-art heuristics. We have found that the approach introduced in this paper grows linearly, which is a significant improvement over existing techniques.","2021","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","61–72","","","","","","","ICPE '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, France","","","","multivariate analysis; software performance antipattern characterization; software performance antipattern detection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wireless mesh networks experience significant temporal and spatial variations in link bandwidth. When application components, modeled as a directed acyclic graph, need to be scheduled on such a mesh with bandwidth constraints (and variations), the problem of mapping components to specific compute nodes becomes an instance of bin packing with constraints of CPU, memory, and bandwidth limits within the mesh. To make the scheduling tractable, we propose BASS (Bandwidth Aware Scheduling System), and develop heuristics for scheduling, based on the directed graph topology of the application components. We evaluate BASS on an emulated mesh using bandwidth traces collected from an actual wireless testbed - CityLab. Detailed evaluations show that contemporary orchestration frameworks can plug in BASS to provide better end-to-end performance for the applications deployed on the mesh while reducing resource utilization.","2024","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","131–144","","","","","","","Middleware '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Hong Kong, Hong Kong","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Orchestrators make use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to determine the most optimal operational decisions, such as deployment and scaling of services, ensuring the quality of the service performance. The training and validation of these models require significant amount of data. However, in such environments we deal with heterogeneous and distributed data sources, in which the data needs to be collected and pre-processed efficiently, and as such, made ready-to-use for these ML models. Hence, in this paper several state-of-the-art data management technologies suitable for edge computing and orchestration are investigated and compared. After investigating the theoretical features of these technologies, they are deployed and tested on the Smart Highway testbed. The strengths and shortcomings of these systems are presented and compared based on the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for various vehicular services dealing with highly mobile users, i.e., vehicles, which are considered as quite stringent.

A number of solutions for efficient processing and storage of big data streams are today available as open source or commercial software. However, the choice of the most applicable solution highly depends on the requirements of a specific use case scenario since the performance of the aforementioned solutions often vary depending on the specific use-case parameters (e.g. incoming data frequency, average size of a single data entry, etc.). Thus, in this paper we examine different platforms adequate for the implementation of a smart metering data acquisition system, to identify the most efficient ones among the considered candidates. The most important requirement of our meter data management system is to offer a stable solution that processes and stores high volumes of continuously incoming data readings with minimal loss-rate. For this purpose we propose a modular solution where components communicate over a message-queuing system, while the ultimate data repository is a NoSQL database. After carrying out all the specifically designed performance tests, we identify the following platforms as the most promising ones to implement our smart metering solution: Kafka as the messaging broker and time-series database InfluxDB. Finally, we verified that our MDMS successfully processes and stores 2.5 M data entries in a time period under eight minutes which confirms its targeted performance efficiency.","2020","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","","","","","","","","IoT '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Malmö, Sweden","","","","Kafka; InfluxDB; MDMS; smart metering; time-series data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The continued evolution of computing hardware and infrastructure imposes new challenges and bottlenecks to program performance. As a result, traditional database architectures that focus solely on I/O optimization increasingly fail to utilize hardware resources efficiently. Multi-core CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, new memory and storage technologies (such as flash and non-volatile memory), and low-power hardware impose great challenges to optimizing database performance. Consequently, exploiting the characteristics of modern hardware has become an important topic of database systems research.The goal is to make database systems adapt automatically to the sophisticated hardware characteristics, thus maximizing performance transparently to applications. To achieve this goal, the data management community needs interdisciplinary collaboration with computer architecture, compiler, operating systems, and storage researchers. This involves rethinking traditional data structures, query processing algorithms, and database software architectures to adapt to the advances in the underlying hardware infrastructure. For the DaMoN Workshop, we seek submissions bridging the area of database systems to computer architecture, compilers, and operating systems.","2023","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One rare place where energy and water coincide is in water heaters, which consume over 30% of household energy in South Africa and collectively pass over 500 billion litres of water annually.

The advent of wireless and cloud computing technology brought expectations of simple management of a multitude of devices and the so-called Internet of Things. A few solutions have been proposed for remote water heater management, but these are not scalable, and have not been benchmarked for scalability above tens of units. This paper proposes an end-to-end architecture to monitor and control EWHs based on MQTT, and specific emphasis is placed on the technologies suitable for large-scale cross-domain interoperability. The performance of the system with 10,000 connections and the results of a pilot deployment are presented.","2017","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","","","","","","","","ICC '17","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Cambridge, United Kingdom","","","","internet of things; smart cities; electric water heaters","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The related video streaming/analytics requires real-time drone-to-Ground Control Station (GCS) communication and computation co-ordination for desired user Quality of Experience (QoE). In situations where the quality of the video can be affected by occlusions (e.g., image distortion, frame stalling) due to network bottlenecks, there is a need to dynamically make decisions on the computation offloading and networking protocols in order to properly handle the video data for real world application purposes. In this paper, we propose a novel function-centric computing approach that helps a user to perform drone video analytics to assess a wide-area scene to chart a plan of action. Our approach involves handling network impairments affecting the switching between high resolution/low resolution video capture, or change of camera direction for assessment of the scene effectively. It also features a novel video quality enhancing algorithm based on occlusion-detection that adapts to video impairments related to image distortion and frame stalling. Our experiment results from a realistic testbed show that our approach can efficiently choose the suitable networking protocols (i.e., TCP/HTTP, UDP/RTP, QUIC) and orchestrate both the camera control on the drone, and the computation off-loading of the video analytics over limited edge computing resources. The performance improvements for computation off-loading involving our video quality enhancing algorithm are shown for different network conditions in terms of occlusion rate and processing times.","2020","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","","","","","","","","ICDCN '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Kolkata, India","","","","Computation off-loading; Drone video analytics; Multimedia networking protocols; Network management; Occlusion detection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These tasks need to be processed or executed by different computational devices used in the network infrastructure for getting meaningful information. Due to the resource-constrained nature of IoMT devices, the devices mostly offload these tasks to various edge devices. The IoMT-Cloud paradigm provides different services storage, computation, and communication for the execution of various IoMT applications with elasticity and scalability on the pay-per-use model. Despite the wonderful benefits of cloud computing, there are various issues that remain unsolved like the response time of an IoMT application must satisfy hard deadlines, and Quality of Service(QoS) parameters. In order to improve the response time, and QoS, a decentralized distributed computing paradigm named Edge computing has emerged as a potential solution to provide computing and networking resources at the edge of the network for different IoT application domains. In this article, a serverless edge computing framework is proposed that provides various IoMT services to emerging healthcare applications.

Production-level systems use lightweight combinations of historical information to enable practical deployments. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) models, in particular Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, have been proposed by various works, for their improved predictive capabilities. Following this trend, we train LSTM models and observe high levels of prediction accuracy, even on unseen data. Upon meticulous visual inspection of the results, we notice that although the predicted values seem highly accurate, they are nothing but versions of the original data shifted by one time step into the future. Yet, this clear shift seems to be enough to produce a robust forecast, because the values are highly correlated across time. We investigate time series data of various resource usage metrics (CPU, memory, network, disk I/O) across different cloud providers and levels, such as at the physical or virtual machine-level and at the application job-level. We observe that resource utilization displays very small variations in consecutive time steps. This insight can enable very simple solutions, such as data shifts, to be used for cloud resource forecasting and deliver highly accurate predictions. This is the reason why we ask whether complex machine learning models are even necessary to use. We envision that practical resource management systems need to first identify the extent to which simple solutions can be effective, and resort to using machine learning to the extent that enables its practical use.","2023","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","544–554","","","","","","","SoCC '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Santa Cruz, CA, USA","","","","Machine Learning; Cloud Computing; Data Persistence; Forecasting; Long Short Term Memory; Persistent Forecast; Prediction; Resource Usage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This becomes a bigger problem at resource-constrained, multi-tenant edge server locations, where it is necessary to scale to a larger number of clients with a fixed resource envelope. Naive approaches which simply minimize the resource budget allocation of each application result in performance degradation that voids the benefits expected from operating at the edge.This paper presents Pocket - a new approach for serving ML applications in settings like the edge, based on a shared ML runtime backend as a service and lightweight ML application pocket containers. Key to realizing Pocket is use of lightweight IPC, support for cross-client isolation, and a novel resource amplification method which inlines resource reallocation with IPC. The latter ensures just-in-time assignment of the limited edge resources where they're most needed, thereby reducing contention effects and boosting overall performance and efficiency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Pocket can scale to 1.3–20× more clients with the same amount of resources while reducing response time by 20–80% compared to monolithic designs.","2023","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","46–62","","","","","","","EuroSys '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Rome, Italy","","","","resource management; containers; edge computing; isolation; IPC; ML serving; runtime-as-a-service; visual analytics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This arises when models are larger than memory, but also systematically when models are deployed on low-resource devices in the Internet of Things or run as cloud microservices where resources are allocated on demand. Block-Aligned Serialized Trees (BLOCKSET) introduce the concept of selective access for random forests and gradient boosted trees in which only the parts of the model needed for inference are deserialized and loaded into memory. %BLOCKSET combines concepts from external memory algorithms and data-parallel %layouts of random forests that maximize I/O-density for in-memory models. Using principles from external memory algorithms, we block-align the serialization format in order to minimize the number of I/Os. For gradient boosted trees, this results in a more than five time reduction in inference latency over layouts that do not perform selective access and a 2 times latency reduction over techniques that are selective, but do not encode I/O block boundaries in the layout.","2021","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","1170–1179","","","","","","","KDD '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, Singapore","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents an innovative Decision Support Framework (DDSF), for managing higher education systems. The DDSF utilizes real time information extraction to improve the decision-making process. It combines data analytics and user centric design to provide insights to education administrators. By gathering data from sources like records, financial reports and social media analytics the DDSF uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to extract and interpret real time information. This information is then organized in a manner for analysis. The framework is adaptable allowing for the inclusion of emerging data streams ensuring relevance and usefulness. To evaluate the effectiveness of the DDSF we conducted a pilot study at a university. The results indicated improvements in meeting student needs optimizing resource allocation and enhancing operational efficiency. The framework also enables policy development by foreseeing challenges and identifying opportunities, within the education sector. The DDSF brings about a way of managing education by providing a strong platform for institutions to succeed in a competitive and constantly evolving environment. It emphasizes the significance of extracting real time information to guide planning and operational excellence. Future studies will concentrate on expanding the framework, for use, across institutions and incorporating analytics to improve foresight abilities.","2024","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","497–502","","","","","","","ICFNDS '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Dubai, United Arab Emirates","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An integrative and interoperable IoT platform proves to be a suitable execution environment for Smart City services because users simultaneously use multiple services, while an IoT platform enables cross-service data sharing. A large number of various IoT and mobile devices as well as the corresponding services can generate tremendous input load on an underlying IoT platform. Thus, it is crucial to analyze the overall input rate on Smart City services to ensure predefined quality of service (e.g., low latency required by some IoT services). An aggregate input rate which characterizes a real world deployment can be used to check if a platform is able to adequately support multiple services running in parallel and to evaluate its overall performance.In this paper we review IoT-based Smart City services to identify key applications characterizing the domain, e.g., smart mobility, smart utilities, and citizen-driven mobile crowd sensing services. Next, we analyze the potential load which such applications pose on IoT services that continuously process the generated data streams. The analysis is used to create a model estimating an aggregate load generated by Smart City applications. We simulate a number of characteristic application compositions to provide insight about the aggregate input load and its potential impact on the performance of Smart City services. The proposed model is a first step towards predicting the processing load of Smart City services to facilitate the assessment and planning of required resources for continuous processing of sensor data in the context of Smart City services.","2017","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","34–43","","","","","","","DEBS '17","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Barcelona, Spain","","","","Internet of Things; input load; model; Smart City services","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, improving the execution efficiency of recommendation directly translates into infrastructure capacity saving. In this paper, we propose DeepRecSched, a recommendation inference scheduler that maximizes latency-bounded throughput by taking into account characteristics of inference query size and arrival patterns, model architectures, and underlying hardware systems. By carefully optimizing task versus data-level parallelism, DeepRecSched improves system throughput on server class CPUs by 2x across eight industry-representative models. Next, we deploy and evaluate this optimization in an at-scale production datacenter which reduces end-to-end tail latency across a wide variety of recommendation models by 30%. Finally, DeepRecSched demonstrates the role and impact of specialized AI hardware in optimizing system level performance (QPS) and power efficiency (QPS/watt) of recommendation inference.In order to enable the design space exploration of customized recommendation systems shown in this paper, we design and validate an end-to-end modeling infrastructure, DeepRecInfra.

This enables real-time processing, reduces latency, and improves user experiences, particularly with the advent of 5G networks. However, the limited resources of edge servers pose a challenge in ensuring service-level agreement (SLA) while optimizing resource utilization. Autoscaling, a dynamic resource adjustment mechanism, can play a pivotal role in meeting these demands. This paper explores the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to address autoscaling in MEC. The proposed algorithm models the horizontal autoscaling problem in MEC, defines state and action spaces, and introduces a global reward function. Additionally, time-series data prediction enhances scaling responsiveness. A testing platform is employed to validate the algorithm’s effectiveness. This work contributes a novel approach to autoscaling in MEC, addressing the complex interplay of autonomous scaling decisions, SLA compliance, and resource optimization within edge server clusters.","2024","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","520–527","","","","","","","ICCIP '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Lingshui, China","","","","autoscaling; mobile edge computing; reinforcement learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Digital twins are used to encapsulate data access and view configurations. Access is enabled on digital twins, not on IoT resources directly. Trust structures programmed as smart contracts are the ones that manage access to digital twins. Consequently, IoT resources are not exposed to third parties, and access security breaches can be prevented. Blockchain has been used to validate digital twins and store their configuration.

Multiple independent parties are increasingly seeking to leverage shared IoT infrastructure, using a similar model to the cloud, and thus require constrained IoT devices to become microservice-hosting platforms that can securely and concurrently execute their code and interoperate. This vision demands that heterogeneous services, peripherals and platforms are provided with an expanded set of security guarantees to prevent third-party services from hijacking the platform, resource-level access control and accounting, and strong isolation between running processes to prevent unauthorized access to third-party services and data. This paper introduces Polyglot CerberOS, a resource-secure operating system for multi-tenant IoT devices that is realised through a reconfigurable virtual machine which can simultaneously execute interoperable services, written in different languages. We evaluate Polyglot CerberOS on IETF Class-1 devices running both Java and C services.

Modern sNICs have fully programmable, energy-efficient multi-core processors on which many packet processing functions, including a full-blown programmable switch, can run. However, having multiple switch instances deployed across the host hypervisor and the attached sNICs makes controlling them difficult and data plane operations more complex.This paper proposes a generalized SDN-controlled NF offload architecture called UNO. It can transparently offload dynamically selected host processors' packet processing functions to sNICs by using multiple switches in the host while keeping the data centerwide network control and management planes unmodified. UNO exposes a single virtual control plane to the SDN controller and hides dynamic NF offload behind a unified virtual management plane. This enables UNO to make optimal use of host's and sNIC's combined packet processing capabilities with local optimization based on locally observed traffic patterns and resource consumption, and without central controller involvement. Experimental results based on a real UNO prototype in realistic scenarios show promising results: it can save processing worth up to 8 CPU cores, reduce power usage by up to 2x, and reduce the control plane overhead by more than 50%.","2017","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","506–519","","","","","","","SoCC '17","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Santa Clara, California","","","","networking and SDNs; virtualization and containers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent studies on digital twins focus on the analysis of the literature on digital twins for automotive or in general and, thus, neglect the industrial perspective of automotive practitioners. To mitigate this gap between scientific literature and the industrial perspective, we conducted a questionnaire survey among experts in the German automotive industry to identify i) the desired purposes for and capabilities of digital twins and ii) the modeling techniques related to engineering and operating digital twins across the phases of automotive development. To this end, we contacted 189 members of the Software-Defined Car research project and received 96 responses.

However, serverless computing is currently limited to homogeneous Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) deployments or simply FaaS Deployment (FaaSD) consisting of deployments of serverless functions using a FaaS platform in a region with certain memory configurations. Extending serverless computing to support Heterogeneous FaaS Deployments (HeteroFaaSDs) consisting of multiple FaaSDs with variable configurations (FaaS platform, region, and memory) and dynamically load balancing the invocations of the functions across these FaaSDs within a HeteroFaaSD can provide an optimal way for handling such serverless functions.In this paper, we present a software system called Courier that is responsible for optimally distributing the invocations of the functions (called delivering of serverless functions) within the HeteroFaaSDs based on the execution time of the functions on the FaaSDs comprising the HeteroFaaSDs. To this end, we developed two approaches: Auto Weighted Round-Robin (AWRR) and PerFunction Auto Weighted Round-Robin (PFAWRR) that use functions execution times for delivering serverless functions within a HeteroFaaSD to reduce the overall execution time. We demonstrate and evaluate the functioning of our developed tool on three HeteroFaaSDs using three FaaS platforms: 1) on-premise Open-Whisk, 2) AWS Lambda, and 3) Google Cloud Functions (GCF). We show that Courier can improve the overall performance of the invocations of the functions within a HeteroFaaSD as compared to traditional load balancing algorithms.","2021","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","","","","","","","","UCC '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Leicester, United Kingdom","","","","serverless computing; function-as-a-service; functions delivery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast to conventional methods that involve creating dedicated models for specific time series application domains, this research advocates for a unified model paradigm that transcends domain boundaries. However, learning an effective cross-domain model presents the following challenges. First, various domains exhibit disparities in data characteristics, e.g., the number of variables, posing hurdles for existing models that impose inflexible constraints on these factors. Second, the model may encounter difficulties in distinguishing data from various domains, leading to suboptimal performance in our assessments. Third, the diverse convergence rates of time series domains can also result in compromised empirical performance. To address these issues, we propose UniTime for effective cross-domain time series learning. Concretely, UniTime can flexibly adapt to data with varying characteristics. It also uses domain instructions and a Language-TS Transformer to offer identification information and align two modalities. In addition, UniTime employs masking to alleviate domain convergence speed imbalance issues. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of UniTime in advancing state-of-the-art forecasting performance and zero-shot transferability.","2024","2025-03-18 09:12:00","2025-03-18 09:12:00","","4095–4106","","","","","","","WWW '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Singapore, Singapore","","","","time series forecasting; language models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The growing demand for computationally expensive, state-of-the-art DNNs, coupled with diminishing performance gains of general-purpose architectures, has fueled an explosion of specialized Neural Processing Units (NPUs). NPUs for interactive services should satisfy two requirements: (1) execution of DNN models with low latency, high throughput, and high efficiency, and (2) flexibility to accommodate evolving state-of-the-art models (e.g., RNNs, CNNs, MLPs) without costly silicon updates.This paper describes the NPU architecture for Project Brainwave, a production-scale system for real-time AI. The Brainwave NPU achieves more than an order of magnitude improvement in latency and throughput over state-of-the-art GPUs on large RNNs at a batch size of 1. The NPU attains this performance using a single-threaded SIMD ISA paired with a distributed microarchitecture capable of dispatching over 7M operations from a single instruction. The spatially distributed microarchitecture, scaled up to 96,000 multiply-accumulate units, is supported by hierarchical instruction decoders and schedulers coupled with thousands of independently addressable high-bandwidth on-chip memories, and can transparently exploit many levels of fine-grain SIMD parallelism. When targeting an FPGA, microarchitectural parameters such as native datapaths and numerical precision can be ""synthesis specialized"" to models at compile time, enabling high FPGA performance competitive with hardened NPUs. When running on an Intel Stratix 10 280 FPGA, the Brainwave NPU achieves performance ranging from ten to over thirty-five teraflops, with no batching, on large, memory-intensive RNNs.","2018","2025-03-18 09:12:01","2025-03-18 09:12:01","","1–14","","","","","","","ISCA '18","","","","IEEE Press","Los Angeles, California","","","","","","","","","","","","accelerator architectures; field programmable gate arrays; neural network hardware","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper discusses the challenges we are facing today in order to provide an analytics platform to reduce cost and increase performance of analytics applications in the cloud computing environment.","2015","2025-03-18 09:12:01","2025-03-18 09:12:01","","","","","","","","","CF '15","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Ischia, Italy","","","","cloud computing; agile cluster provisioning; analytics application; analytics platform; cluster sizing; in memory computing; MapReduce; spark","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there are challenges as IoT devices have limited resources for running multiple simultaneous containerized functions, and also FaaS does not typically support long-running functions. Our implementation utilizes Docker and CRIU for checkpointing and suspending long-running blocking functions. The results show that checkpointing is slightly slower than regular Docker pause, but it saves memory and allows for more long-running functions to be run on an IoT device. Furthermore, the resulting checkpoint files are small, hence they are suitable for live migration and backing up stateful functions, therefore improving availability and reliability of the system.","2019","2025-03-18 09:12:01","2025-03-18 09:12:01","","60–65","","","","","","","EdgeSys '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Dresden, Germany","","","","serverless; Internet of Things; checkpointing; function as a service; light-weight virtualization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It refers to a fine-grained deployment model where applications, comprising of one or more functions, are uploaded to a platform and then executed, scaled, and billed in response to the exact demand needed at the moment. While elite cloud vendors such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and IBM are now providing serverless computing, their approach for the placement of functions, i.e. associated container or sandbox, on servers is oblivious to the workload which may lead to poor performance and/or higher operational cost for software owners. In this paper, using statistical machine learning, we design and evaluate an adaptive function placement algorithm which can be used by serverless computing platforms to optimize the performance of running functions while minimizing the operational cost. Given a fixed amount of resources, our smart spread function placement algorithm results in higher performance compared to existing approaches; this will be achieved by maintaining the users' desired quality of service for a longer time which prevents premature scaling of the cloud resources. Extensive experimental studies revealed that the proposed adaptive function placement algorithm can be easily adopted by serverless computing providers and integrated to container orchestration platforms without introducing any limiting side effects.","2019","2025-03-18 09:12:01","2025-03-18 09:12:01","","203–213","","","","","","","CASCON '19","","","","IBM Corp.","USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Toronto, Ontario, Canada","","","","machine learning; serverless computing; optimization; container placement algorithms; predictive performance modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A high performance User Plane Function (UPF), the main element in the 5G user plane, is critical to achieving these performance goals. This paper presents AccelUPF, a 5G UPF that offloads functionality to programmable dataplane hardware for performance acceleration. While prior work has proposed accelerating the UPF by offloading its data forwarding functionality to programmable hardware, the Packet Forwarding Control Protocol (PFCP) messages from the control plane that configure the hardware data forwarding rules were still processed in software. We show that only offloading data forwarding and not PFCP message processing leads to suboptimal performance in the UPF for applications like IoT that have a much higher ratio of PFCP messages to data traffic, due to a bottleneck at the software control plane that configures the hardware packet forwarding rules. In contrast to prior work, AccelUPF offloads both PFCP message processing as well as data forwarding to programmable hardware. AccelUPF overcomes several technical challenges pertaining to the processing of the complex variable-sized PFCP messages within the memory and compute constraints of programmable hardware platforms. Our evaluation of AccelUPF implemented over a Netronome programmable NIC and an Intel Tofino programmable switch demonstrates performance gains over the state-of-the-art UPFs for real-world traffic scenarios.","2022","2025-03-18 09:12:01","2025-03-18 09:12:01","","1–15","","","","","","","SOSR '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event","","","","in-network computation; 5G core; 5G user plane; programmable networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clara can analyze an unported NF in its original form, and predict its performance when ported to a SmartNIC target. This automated workflow enables the developer to easily customize offloading strategies, obtain performance insights, and identify suitable SmartNIC models for her workloads. Clara's key technical roadmap is to emulate a compiler, lowering an unported program to a SmartNIC target logically, without performing code generation. This results in a mapping from core NF logic to SmartNIC hardware resources, and Clara then plugs in NIC parameters to predict the performance for specific workloads.

Alternative technologies, such as NVMe SSDs and upcoming NVM devices, offer higher capacity than DRAM at a fraction of the cost and power. One promising approach is to transparently offload colder memory to cheaper memory technologies via kernel or hypervisor techniques. The key challenge, however, is to develop a datacenter-scale solution that is robust in dealing with diverse workloads and large performance variance of different offload devices such as compressed memory, SSD, and NVM. This paper presents TMO, Meta’s transparent memory offloading solution for heterogeneous datacenter environments. TMO introduces a new Linux kernel mechanism that directly measures in realtime the lost work due to resource shortage across CPU, memory, and I/O. Guided by this information and without any prior application knowledge, TMO automatically adjusts how much memory to offload to heterogeneous devices (e.g., compressed memory or SSD) according to the device’s performance characteristics and the application’s sensitivity to memory-access slowdown. TMO holistically identifies offloading opportunities from not only the application containers but also the sidecar containers that provide infrastructure-level functions. To maximize memory savings, TMO targets both anonymous memory and file cache, and balances the swap-in rate of anonymous memory and the reload rate of file pages that were recently evicted from the file cache. TMO has been running in production for more than a year, and has saved between 20-32% of the total memory across millions of servers in our large datacenter fleet. We have successfully upstreamed TMO into the Linux kernel.","2022","2025-03-18 09:12:01","2025-03-18 09:12:01","","609–621","","","","","","","ASPLOS '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Lausanne, Switzerland","","","","Datacenters; Memory Management; Non-volatile Memory; Operating Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These monolithic applications rely on vertical scaling, adjusting CPU cores based on load fluctuations. However, our analysis of Kubernetes-based Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) offerings at Microsoft revealed that many customers consistently over-provision resources for peak workloads, neglecting cost-saving opportunities through resource scale-down. We found that there is a gap in the ability of existing vertical autoscaling tools to minimize resource slack and respond promptly to throttling, leading to increased costs and impacting crucial metrics such as throughput and availability.To address this challenge, we propose CaaSPER, a vertical autoscaling algorithm that blends reactive and proactive strategies. By dynamically adjusting CPU resources, CaaSPER minimizes resource slack, maintains optimal CPU utilization, and reduces throttling. Importantly, customers have the flexibility to prioritize either cost savings or high performance based on their preferences. Extensive testing demonstrates that CaaSPER effectively reduces throttling and keeps CPU utilization within target levels. CaaSPER is designed to be application-agnostic and platform-agnostic, with potential for extension to other applications requiring vertical autoscaling.","2024","2025-03-18 09:12:01","2025-03-18 09:12:01","","241–254","","","","","","","SIGMOD/PODS '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Santiago AA, Chile","","","","kubernetes; containers; resource optimization; vertical auto-scaling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These three pillars reflect our collective commitment to fostering a vibrant, supportive, and forwardthinking environment within the CCS community. Particularly, we host our inaugural Doctoral Symposium, which offers PhD students a unique platform to receive timely, constructive feedback on their dissertation research from leading experts in our community. Additionally, our first-ever Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Workshop is designed to cultivate a culture that embraces diversity and champions equity in our field. Moreover, understanding the importance of guidance and support, we have organized panels focusing on Student Mentoring, Faculty Mentoring, and Public Service. These panels are designed to facilitate mentorship connections, share valuable experiences, and encourage service that extends the impact of our work beyond academia. These new initiatives are also opportunities to strengthen the bonds within our CCS community.Regarding the main conference, this year's main conference is our largest ever, featuring 328 paper presentations that showcase the latest research and developments in our field. We are also honored to have two distinguished keynote speakers: Dr. Dan Boneh and Dr. Gene Tsudik, who will share their invaluable insights and perspectives on pressing topics in security and privacy.

Ideally, these systems should be proactive, able to detect the right moment and place to offer suggestions of a specific type of item or activity to the user. For this purpose, push-based recommender systems can be used, exploiting context rules to decide when a specific type of recommendation should be triggered. However, experiences regarding the implementation of these types of systems are scarce. Motivated by this, in this paper, we describe our design and implementation efforts focusing on the ability to fire suitable recommendations, without user intervention, whenever it is required. In our proposal, the mobile user can activate, deactivate, parametrize, and define rules in an easy way, to obtain a better user personalization. Besides, the recommendation triggering is performed on the mobile device, which allows minimizing the amount of wireless communications and helps to protect the user’s privacy (as context data is evaluated locally on the device, rather than by an external server). We have analyzed several technological options and evaluated the performance and scalability of our proposal, showing its feasibility.","2022","2025-03-18 09:12:01","2025-03-18 09:12:01","","562–570","","","","","","","iiWAS2021","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Linz, Austria","","","","data management; mobile devices; mobile computing; context rules; mobile context-aware recommender systems; push-based recommendations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluate PARTIES on state-of-the-art server platforms across a set of diverse interactive services.

So far, there are almost no attempts to make the past application history programmatically accessible or even modifiable. This is primarily due to the complexity of temporal changes and a difficult alignment with prevalent programming primitives and persistence strategies. Retroactive computing enables powerful capabilities though, including computations and predictions of alternate application timelines, post-hoc bug fixes, or retroactive state explorations. We propose an event-driven programming model that is oriented towards serverless computing and applies retroaction to the event sourcing paradigm. Our model is deliberately restrictive, but therefore keeps the complexity of retroactive operations in check. We introduce retro-λ, a runtime platform that implements the model and provides retroactive capabilites to its applications. While retro-λ only shows negligible performance overheads compared to similar solutions for running regular applications, it enables its users to execute retroactive computations on the application histories as part of its programming model.","2018","2025-03-18 09:12:01","2025-03-18 09:12:01","","76–87","","","","","","","DEBS '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Hamilton, New Zealand","","","","serverless computing; event processing; event sourcing; event-driven architecture; retroaction; retroactive computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of these challenges is keeping a stable energy grid when transitioning the production to unpredictable energy generation from green sources. Demand Response (DR) can mitigate some of the lack of predictability by influencing the consumer’s load profile. Unfortunately, the cost of implementing DR, and the required infrastructure, vastly overshadows the benefits for the consumer, thereby negating the incentive to invest. Therefore, reducing the initial cost of investment is a critical factor for the success of DR. Building Operating Systems (BOS) is one possible avenue to achieve DR functionality in buildings. This paper seeks to reduce initial investment costs of BOSes, by introducing an ontology-based package manager (OPM), that dynamically resolves dependencies and installs services. An ontology-based approach to dependency resolution allows for loosely defined dependencies but also takes the context of the service into account, as well as requirements in terms of sensor availability and physical layout of the building. The OPM is evaluated by deploying a BOS and accompanying services for occupancy prediction. By significantly reducing deployment complexity, results show considerable time savings, and thereby cost reductions, on deployment and maintenance activities.","2022","2025-03-18 09:12:01","2025-03-18 09:12:01","","118–125","","","","","","","IoT '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: St.Gallen, Switzerland","","","","ontology; containerization; deployment; building operating systems; dependency resolution; OWL; Package manager","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is mainly because realistic test scenarios are employed (e.g., for testing elevator dispatching algorithms, typically a full day of passengers traveling through a system of elevators is used). However, in such a context, when needing to reproduce a failure, it is of high benefit to provide the minimal test input to the software developers. This way, analyzing and trying to localize the root-cause of the failure is easier and more agile. Delta debugging has been found to be an efficient technique to reduce failure-inducing test inputs. In this paper, we enhance this technique by first monitoring the environment at which the CPS operates as well as its physical states. With the monitored information, we search for stable states of the CPS during the execution of the simulation. In a second step, we use such identified stable states to help the delta debugging algorithm isolate the failure-inducing test inputs more efficiently. We report our experience of applying our approach into an industrial elevator dispatching algorithm. An empirical evaluation carried out with real operational data from a real installation of elevators suggests that the proposed environment-wise delta debugging algorithm is between 1.3 to 1.8 times faster than the traditional delta debugging, while producing a larger reduction in the failure-inducing test inputs. The results provided by the different implemented delta debugging algorithm versions are qualitatively assessed with domain experts. This assessment provides new insights and lessons learned, such as, potential applications of the delta debugging algorithm beyond debugging.","2023","2025-03-18 09:12:01","2025-03-18 09:12:01","","1055–1067","","","","","","","ISSTA 2023","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Seattle, WA, USA","","","","Cyber-Physical Systems; Delta Debugging; Simulation-based Testing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cloud Testing and more specifically ""testing in the cloud” has arisen to tackle those challenges. In this new paradigm, cloud-based environment and infrastructure are used to run realistic end-to-end and/or system-level tests, collect test data and analyse them. In this paper we present a set of cloud-native services to take from the tester the responsibility of managing the resources and complementary services required to simulate realistic operational conditions and production environments. Specifically, they provide cloud testing capabilities such as logs and measurements collection from both testing jobs and system under test; test data analytics and visualization; provisioning and operation of additional services and processes to replicate realistic production ecosystems; support to scalability and diversity of underlying testing infrastructure; and replication of the operational conditions of the software under test through its instrumentation.

Networked applications can leak sensitive information even when they use encryption. For example, some characteristics of network packets, such as their size, timing and direction, are visible even for encrypted traffic. Patterns in these characteristics can be leveraged as side channels to extract information about secret values accessed by the application. In this paper, we present a new tool called AutoFeed for detecting and quantifying information leakage due to side channels in networked software applications. AutoFeed profiles the target system and automatically explores the input space, explores the space of output features that may leak information, quantifies the information leakage, and identifies the top-leaking features. Given a set of input mutators and a small number of initial inputs provided by the user, AutoFeed iteratively mutates inputs and periodically updates its leakage estimations to identify the features that leak the greatest amount of information about the secret of interest. AutoFeed uses a feedback loop for incremental profiling, and a stopping criterion that terminates the analysis when the leakage estimation for the top-leaking features converges. AutoFeed also automatically assigns weights to mutators in order to focus the search of the input space on exploring dimensions that are relevant to the leakage quantification. Our experimental evaluation on the benchmarks shows that AutoFeed is effective in detecting and quantifying information leaks in networked applications.","2020","2025-03-18 09:12:01","2025-03-18 09:12:01","","260–271","","","","","","","ISSTA 2020","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, USA","","","","dynamic program analysis; input generation; network traffic analysis; Side-channel analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many applications perform real-time analytics on these IoT workloads by performing continuous stream processing for a window of sequence data elements. However, executing light-weight stateful functions on server CPUs adds to the communication latency of each small message in a high data rate environment, primarily due to messages traveling through a complex network stack to reach the CPU. Thus, we present an in-network function deployment architecture with low latency and low resource footprint by introducing a new compute layer. We propose an FPGA-based Switch/NIC prototype with a compute layer utilizing RISC-V soft cores and High-Level Synthesis modules.

To address this problem, we suggest a methodology for performance engineering and performance analysis of distributed event-sourced systems based on specific measurements and subsequent, targeted optimizations. The methodology blends in well into existing software engineering processes and helps developers to identify bottlenecks and to resolve performance issues.

Generating accurate benchmarks plays an essential role in designing the fast-paced software and hardware solutions in this space. Two fundamental challenges to make this scalable are (i) workload representativeness and (ii) the ability to quickly incorporate changes to the fleet into the benchmarks.To overcome these issues, we propose Mystique, an accurate and scalable framework for production AI benchmark generation. It leverages the PyTorch execution trace (ET), a new feature that captures the runtime information of AI models at the granularity of operators, in a graph format, together with their metadata. By sourcing fleet ETs, we can build AI benchmarks that are portable and representative. Mystique is scalable, due to its lightweight data collection, in terms of runtime overhead and instrumentation effort. It is also adaptive because ET composability allows flexible control on benchmark creation.We evaluate our methodology on several production AI models, and show that benchmarks generated with Mystique closely resemble original AI models, both in execution time and system-level metrics. We also showcase the portability of the generated benchmarks across platforms, and demonstrate several use cases enabled by the fine-grained composability of the execution trace.","2023","2025-03-18 09:12:01","2025-03-18 09:12:01","","","","","","","","","ISCA '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Orlando, FL, USA","","","","cloud computing; benchmarking; artificial intelligence; code generation; performance cloning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Software 2.0 paradigm is a data-driven programming that requires specialized data management to get clean, governed and unbiased data sets, well defined neural network architectures for building a model, efficient model training, extensive testing and high performance deployment. Unlike Software 1.0 paradigm, a Software 2.0 program's output is probabilistic in nature as the correctness is highly dependent on the size and quality of the input data, however the program's performance is deterministic. This has led to the research in specialized hardware and high performance architectures for deep-learning algorithms. Also, the nature of Software 2.0 paradigm brings in heterogeneity in the whole life cycle starting from an application development until its deployment in the production environment and hence posing numerous architecture and performance challenges.In this paper, we outline the research problems that will emerge due to migration of apart of Software 1.0 to Software 2.0.

We extend this FaaS model so that it is suitable for use in all tiers of scale for IoT - sensors, edge devices, and cloud - to facilitate robust, portable, and low-latency IoT application development and deployment.To enable this, we combine the use of Linux containers and namespaces for isolation and portability, an append-only object store for robust persistence, and a causal event log for triggering functions and tracking event dependencies. We present the design and implementation of CSPOT, detail its abstractions and APIs, and overview examples of its use.

Aims: The goal of this work is to understand how ESEM research is perceived within the practitioner community and provide feedback to the ESEM community ensure our research remains relevant. Method: To understand how practitioners perceive ESEM research, we replicated previous work by sending a survey to several hundred industry practitioners at a number of companies around the world. We asked the survey participants to rate the relevance of the research described in 156 ESEM papers published between 2011 and 2015. Results: We received 9,941 ratings by 437 practitioners who labeled ideas as Essential, Worth-while, Unimportant, or Unwise. The results showed that overall, industrial practitioners find the work published in ESEM to be valuable: 67% of all ratings were essential or worthwhile. We found no correlation between citation count and perceived relevance of the papers. Through a qualitative analysis, we also identified a number of research themes on which practitioners would like to see an increased research focus. Conclusions: The work published in ESEM is generally relevant to industrial practitioners. There are a number of topics for which those practitioners would like to see additional research undertaken.","2016","2025-03-18 09:12:01","2025-03-18 09:12:01","","","","","","","","","ESEM '16","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Ciudad Real, Spain","","","","Survey; ESEM Conference; Industrial Relevance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Agile methods have made significant contributions to speeding up software development, but often encounter problems with reliability, scalability, and evolvability. Over the past 3 years, we have been experimenting with an approach called Resilient Agile (RA), which addresses these problems while also speeding up development by finding enablers for parallel systems engineering, development, and test. This paper summarizes our experience in defining and evolving RA by applying it to three representative emergent-technology applications: Location-Based Advertising, Picture Sharing, and Bad Driver Reporting. In comparison with the mainstream Architected Agile process that we had been using on similar systems, the RA process achieved fewer defects and significant speedups in system development and evolution. The paper summarizes the overall challenge of software schedule compression; identifies managed parallel development as generally the most powerful but least-practiced strategy for schedule compression; summarizes the key elements required to support parallelism, including specific model-driven system development techniques, automatic generation of key elements and realistic schedule and effort estimation. It then summarizes the three successful Resilient Agile projects to date, provides criteria for selecting a Resilient Agile process, and summarizes the key techniques for scaling up Resilient Agile, using a previous million-line command and control project as an example.","2017","2025-03-18 09:12:01","2025-03-18 09:12:01","","60–69","","","","","","","ICSSP '17","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Paris, France","","","","microservice architecture; code generation; agile development; ICSM; MVC; NoSQL; parallel development; rapid delivery; resilient software; REST; scalable software development; schedule compression; UML modeling; use case driven development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A common obstacle to replication is that recreating the hardware and software environments is often impractical. As researchers usually run their experiments on the hardware and software that happens to be available to them, recreating the experiments would require obtaining identical hardware, which can lead to high costs. Recreating the software environment is also difficult, as software components such as particular library versions might no longer be available. Cheap, standardized hardware components like the Raspberry Pi and portable software containers like the ones provided by Docker are a potential solution to meet the challenge of replicability. In this paper, we report on experiences from replicating performance experiments on Raspberry Pi devices with and without Docker and show that good replication results can be achieved for microbenchmarks such as JMH. Replication of macrobenchmarks like SPECjEnterprise 2010 proves to be much more difficult, as they are strongly affected by (non-standardized) peripherals. Inspired by previous microbenchmarking experiments on the Pi platform, we furthermore report on a systematic analysis of response time fluctuations, and present lessons learned on dos and don»ts for replicable performance experiments.","2018","2025-03-18 09:12:01","2025-03-18 09:12:01","","305–316","","","","","","","ICPE '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Berlin, Germany","","","","performance benchmark; Raspberry pi; replicability; single-board computer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such a trend is already happening in the domain of machine learning and Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems built on edge devices. Yet, debugging and testing methods for heterogeneous applications are currently lacking. These applications may look similar to regular C/C++ code but include hardware synthesis details in terms of preprocessor directives. Therefore, their behavior under heterogeneous architectures may diverge significantly from CPU due to hardware synthesis details. Further, the compilation and hardware simulation cycle takes an enormous amount of time, prohibiting frequent invocations required for fuzz testing. We propose a novel fuzz testing technique, called HeteroFuzz, designed to specifically target heterogeneous applications and to detect platform-dependent divergence. The key essence of HeteroFuzz is that it uses a three-pronged approach to reduce the long latency of repetitively invoking a hardware simulator on a heterogeneous application. First, in addition to monitoring code coverage as a fuzzing guidance mechanism, we analyze synthesis pragmas in kernel code and monitor accelerator-relevant value spectra. Second, we design dynamic probabilistic mutations to increase the chance of hitting divergent behavior under different platforms. Third, we memorize the boundaries of seen kernel inputs and skip HLS simulator invocation if it can expose only redundant divergent behavior. We evaluate HeteroFuzz on seven real-world heterogeneous applications with FPGA kernels. HeteroFuzz is 754X faster in exposing the same set of distinct divergence symptoms than naive fuzzing. Probabilistic mutations contribute to 17.5X speed up than the one without. Selective invocation of HLS simulation contributes to 8.8X speed up than the one without.","2021","2025-03-18 09:12:01","2025-03-18 09:12:01","","242–254","","","","","","","ESEC/FSE 2021","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Athens, Greece","","","","Fuzz testing; heterogeneous applications; platform-dependent divergence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thereby, various physical entities, humans and computer programs are dynamically networked while being situated in different locations. For system stakeholders, reliable operation requires intelligible design and adaptability at run time. The more users can adjust IoT systems dynamically, the more transparent has to be how specific requirements can be met. Executable and role-specific process models are a viable starting point, as they represent the behavior of components and the flow of control. However, they need to be extended with effective data exchange mechanisms between IoT system elements. In this paper, we utilize the subject-oriented concept and notation for role-specific process modeling and communication design of IoT systems and enrich them with a data sharing facility, so-called shared input pools. In order to avoid a single point of failure in system operation, we propose to implement them as blockchains. IoT-elements can then interact and exchange data in a semantically correct and robust way, in particular when behavior changes may occur dynamically.","2019","2025-03-18 09:12:01","2025-03-18 09:12:01","","","","","","","","","S-BPM ONE '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Seville, Spain","","","","internet of things; events; reliable communications; S-BPM; shared input pool; subject orientation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, it has advantages of low-cost, low-energy, and high-robustness, showing great potential in resources-constrained, volatile, and latency-critical applications, which are critical for future HPC, cloud, and edge applications. However, the promised significant performance gain of BNN inference has never been fully demonstrated on general-purpose processors, particularly on GPUs, due to: (i) the challenge of extracting and leveraging sufficient finegrained bit-level-parallelism to saturate GPU cores when the batch size is small; (ii) the fundamental design conflict between bit-based BNN algorithm and word-based architecture; and (iii) architecture &amp; performance unfriendly to BNN network design. To address (i) and (ii), we propose a binarized-soft-tensor-core as a software-hardware codesign approach to construct bit-manipulation capability for modern GPUs and thereby effectively harvest bit-level-parallelism (BLP). To tackle (iii), we propose intra- and inter-layer fusion techniques so that the entire BNN inference execution can be packed into a single GPU kernel, and so avoid the high-cost of frequent launching and releasing. Experiments show that our Singular-Binarized-Neural-Network (SBNN) design can achieve over 1000X speedup for raw inference latency over the state-of-the-art full-precision BNN inference for AlexNet on GPUs. Comparisons with CPU, GPU, FPGA and Xeon-Phi demonstrate the effectiveness of our design.

However, to keep up with future Internet architectural trends the wider area of future Internet paradigms, there is a pressing need to support edge/fog computing environments, where cloud functionality is available more proximate to where the data is generated and needs processing.With this goal in mind, we propose Named Function as a Service (NFaaS), a framework that extends the Named Data Networking architecture to support in-network function execution. In contrast to existing works, NFaaSbuilds on very lightweight VMs and allows for dynamic execution of custom code. Functions can be downloaded and run by any node in the network. Functions can move between nodes according to user demand, making resolution of moving functions a first-class challenge. NFaaSincludes a Kernel Store component, which is responsible not only for storing functions, but also for making decisions on which functions to run locally. NFaaSincludes a routing protocol and a number of forwarding strategies to deploy and dynamically migrate functions within the network. We validate our design through extensive simulations, which show that delay-sensitive functions are deployed closer to the edge, while less delay-sensitive ones closer to the core.","2017","2025-03-18 09:12:01","2025-03-18 09:12:01","","134–144","","","","","","","ICN '17","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Berlin, Germany","","","","mobile edge computing; function migration; information centric networking; network architectures; networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While a large body of research already covers how to optimally operate a cloud system, we still lack insights into how professional software engineers actually use clouds, and how the cloud impacts development practices. This paper reports on the first systematic study on how software developers build applications for the cloud. We conducted a mixed-method study, consisting of qualitative interviews of 25 professional developers and a quantitative survey with 294 responses. Our results show that adopting the cloud has a profound impact throughout the software development process, as well as on how developers utilize tools and data in their daily work. Among other things, we found that (1) developers need better means to anticipate runtime problems and rigorously define metrics for improved fault localization and (2) the cloud offers an abundance of operational data, however, developers still often rely on their experience and intuition rather than utilizing metrics. From our findings, we extracted a set of guidelines for cloud development and identified challenges for researchers and tool vendors.","2015","2025-03-18 09:12:01","2025-03-18 09:12:01","","393–403","","","","","","","ESEC/FSE 2015","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Bergamo, Italy","","","","cloud computing; user study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
