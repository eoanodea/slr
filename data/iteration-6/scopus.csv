Diverse IoT use cases, including smart cities, smart grids, Industry 5.0, eHealth, and autonomous vehicles, are contributing to this increase in energy consumption. Optimising energy utilisation is crucial to sustaining the exponential growth of IoT applications, which demand stringent delays and latencies measured in milliseconds and microseconds. There are additional complexities with the emergence of edge, fog, and cloud computing and the need to manage the energy consumption at all the layers. In this paper, mechanisms that can be used to minimise energy consumption within an edge–fog–cloud IoT architecture for real-time IoT applications are being proposed. We investigate mechanisms for optimal node selection, primarily focusing on minimising energy usage while adhering to the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of various IoT requests. The mechanisms include genetic, modified genetic, and delay-aware algorithms tailored explicitly for real-time IoT applications. We evaluated the proposed mechanisms using a simulation of diverse network scenarios. The results presented in the paper provide insight into balancing processing time and energy efficiency, which are critical considerations in sustainably developing IoT applications in an edge–fog–cloud IoT architecture. © 2025 The Author(s)","Convergence; Edge computing; Fog computing; IoT; Node selection; Resource allocation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216975149"

However, these benefits, to be eventuated, require efforts in the area of resource provisioning and scaling, to match resources to current and future demand, and this is not always trivial to achieve. Since workload may fluctuate substantially in cloud environments, over-provisioning is a common practice to avoid abrupt quality of service (QoS) drops that may result in service level agreement (SLA) violations, but at the price of increased provisioning costs and energy consumption. Workload prediction is one of the strategies by which efficiency and operational cost of a clouds can be improved. Therefore, in this paper, we show the potential benefits of a proactive resource provisioning scheme augmented by three of the most promising machine learning prediction techniques in this context, namely ARIMA, MLP, and GRU, that are known to be able to cope with the dynamic behavior of our target applications. We analyze the trade-off between resource consumption and quality of service using SLA violations in web workloads, considering real case provisioning requirements and constraints, extensively simulating and analyzing the impact of prediction and scaling intervals, and publishing all used tools and datasets to allow reproducibility.

In light of the research findings, the rapid development of intelligent construction follows the strategies of standardization, digitization, intellectualization, collaboration, greenization, and customization, which mainly support “4S” technologies. The popular research topics covering intelligent engineering services for the project's full lifecycle (i.e., design, construction, operation, and maintenance) and even the city level have been deeply explored, which are proven to dramatically improve project efficiency, safety, and automation. Moreover, challenges exist in three potential paths for future research, including the digital twin-enabled engineering cloud platform, man-machine-environment interaction, great sustainability under carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals.

These disruptions can be caused by a variety of factors, such as hardware failures, software glitches, cyber attacks, or even natural disasters. Modern computational environments need applications that can recover quickly from major disruptions while also being environmentally sustainable. Balancing system resilience with energy efficiency is challenging, as efforts to improve one can harm the other. This paper presents a method to enhance disaster survivability in microservice architectures, particularly those using Kubernetes in cloud-based environments, focusing on optimizing electrical energy use. Aiming to save energy, our work adopt the consolidation strategy that means grouping multiple microservices on a single host. Our aproach uses a widely adopted analytical model, the Generalized Stochastic Petri Net (GSPN). GSPN are a powerful modeling technique that is widely used in various fields, including engineering, computer science, and operations research. One of the primary advantages of GSPN is its ability to model complex systems with a high degree of accuracy. Additionally, GSPN allows for the modeling of both logical and stochastic behavior, making it ideal for systems that involve a combination of both. Our GSPN models compute a number of metrics such as: recovery time, system availability, reliability, Mean Time to Failure, and the configuration of cloud-based microservices. We compared our approach against others focusing on survivability or efficiency. Our approach aligns with Recovery Time Objectives during sudden disasters and offers the fastest recovery, requiring 9% less warning time to fully recover in cases of disaster with alert when compared to strategies with similar electrical consumption. It also saves about 27% energy compared to low consolidation strategies and 5% against high consolidation under static conditions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2024.","68M14; 68M15; 68U01; Availability; Microservices; Petri nets; Reliability; Survivabiliry","Balancing; Energy efficiency; Network security; Petri nets; Power management; Recovery; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; 68m14; 68m15; 68u01; Cloud-based; Energy aware; Generalized Stochastic Petri nets; Microservice; Survivabiliry; System resiliences; Unexpected events; Disasters","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196171876"

Rural regions, characterized by having low population densities, suffer this lack of provision the most. On top of that, the remoteness and complicated orography of rural localities render traditional network infrastructure close to useless. To ensure that these localities benefit from access to digital services and to the Internet, we envision the use of swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Through computing enabled UAVs, the deployment of IoT applications decomposed into microservices that have an impact in the main socio-economic activities becomes a possibility. However, UAVs consume a lot of battery power, which complicates the feasibility of their use in real-world environments. To overcome this limitation, in this paper the energy optimal deployment and migration of microservices is studied, resulting in an Mix Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem formulation. As a result, an optimal battery drain aware deployer and migrator of microservices in UAV-based networks is proposed. Our method has proved effective during the simulation, perfectly balancing the work load between UAVs, thus balancing also battery drain and maximizing fly time. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Energy efficiency; IoT; Microservices migration; UAV","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214268619"

By leveraging the capabilities of IoMT devices for real-time data collection, the proposed CMS's robust sensing, storage, and processing features support efficient resource allocation in hospital environments. The proposed approach achieves approximately 35% reduction in latency, a 25% improvement in energy efficiency, and a 40% decrease in Age of Information (AoI) compared to traditional frameworks. The multi-objective optimization problem minimizes energy consumption and latency while ensuring fairness and timely data collection, which is particularly critical in patient monitoring and time-sensitive diagnostics scenarios. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods solve the resource allocation challenge under realistic constraints. Specifically, Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (TD3) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithms are adopted to optimize task scheduling and system decisions in dynamic, resource-constrained settings. Simulation results demonstrate that SAC achieves approximately 20% faster convergence and 15% better adaptability in dynamic hospital environments compared to TD3, making it more suitable for real-time healthcare applications.

In this paper, we propose an automated guided vehicle (AGV)-assisted adaptive cooperative transmission scheme to minimize the mean square error of state estimation at a low energy cost. Specifically, a novel performance index, estimation gain, is introduced to evaluate the benefit of scheduling one sensor for estimation error reduction. Then, sensor scheduling and data transmission are jointly optimized to minimize the time-accumulated estimation error, which is challenging to directly solve due to the unclear impact of imperfect transmission on estimation performance. To this end, an estimation gain-based algorithm is designed to determine the scheduled sensors. Besides, an iterative algorithm is designed to solve the adaptive cooperative transmission problem. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms benchmark schemes in reducing estimation error and energy consumption. © 2024 IEEE.","AGV; cooperative transmission; industrial IoT systems; sensor scheduling; state estimation","Automatic guided vehicles; Benchmarking; Channel estimation; Scheduling algorithms; State estimation; Automated guided vehicles; Cooperative transmission; Estimation errors; Industrial automation; Industrial internet of thing system; Internet of things technologies; Sensor scheduling; Sensory data; System state; Wireless channel; Energy utilization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205830375"

The major concern of cloud-edge-end collaboration lies on resource management. However, the joint optimization of heterogeneous resources involves multiple timescales, and the optimization decisions of different timescales are intertwined. In addition, burst electromagnetic interference will affect the channel environment of the distribution grid, leading to inaccuracies in optimization decisions, which can result in negative influences such as slow convergence and strong fluctuations. Hence, we propose a cloud-edge-end collaborative multi-timescale multi-service resource management algorithm. Large-timescale device scheduling is optimized by sliding window pricing matching, which enables accurate matching estimation and effective conflict elimination. Small-timescale compression level selection and power control are jointly optimized by disturbance-robust upper confidence bound (UCB), which perceives the presence of electromagnetic interference and adjusts exploration tendency for convergence improvement.

Currently, there has been extensive research on threat modeling for cyberattacks. However, there remains a significant gap in research concerning threat modeling for attacks specially targeting IoT devices within the fifth-generation communication environment. In this paper, we present IoT Targeting-Threat Modeling(I3TM) framework established by analyzing botnets that are appeared before 2021 such as Mirai, Pink etc. Through this framework, we identify tactics and techniques to respond to the attacks. Using the identified tactics and techniques from our proposed framework, we can promptly respond to the newly detected attacks. We constructed a Threat Modeling Framework Keyword-Based Metrics to show extracted keywords from reports, academic papers, and white paper that identifies the features of botnet. We also provide an objective way to apply those keywords to the framework. Our framework is organized to analyze the attack process of botnets that may occur against IoT. The framework derives execution for each tactic for objective analysis based on keywords. In the validation for the framework, I3TM identified eight Tactics from Medusa botnet. If the application of the I3TM framework is continuously accumulated, a baseline of similar attack methods and data will be formed.

This study addresses this gap by introducing a comprehensive OCC workflow and conducting a case study in an office building in Changsha, China. Firstly, three months of meteorological, indoor environmental, and energy interaction behavior data were collected by multiple IoT sensors from November 2023 to January 2024. In the second step, indoor comfort levels were analyzed according to ASHRAE standards, revealing that 15.3 % of the time during this period fell within uncomfortable intervals. Based on these findings, an OCC experiment was proposed to improve indoor comfort. A data-driven air-conditioning usage behavior model was developed. Subsequently, a two-week pre-heating experiment was conducted following the recommendations of the proposed model. For comparison, non-heating and pre-heating days were alternated. Finally, the experiment was evaluated using occupants' thermal comfort voting and energy consumption analysis. Participants' thermal comfort was recorded using five metrics and one behavioral metric via surveys. Five metrics include thermal sensation, comfort, preference and acceptance. The results indicated a significant improvement in occupant comfort levels, with acceptance ratings increasing from an average of 3.78–4.38. With pre-heating, the air conditioning energy consumption increased by 1.35 kWh per person per day, representing an increase of approximately 0.98 % overall energy usage. Additionally, a web-based platform named OBIoT was developed to integrate this workflow. These findings provide meaningful insights for improving indoor comfort and optimizing energy consumption. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Air-conditioner; IoT technology; Occupant-centric control; Office building; Thermal comfort","ASHRAE standards; Preheating; Space heating; Thermal comfort; Air conditioner; Case-studies; Comfort level; Indoor comforts; IoT technology; Occupant-centric control; Office space; Pre-heating; Thermal; Work-flows; Air conditioning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216374938"

Sensors and actuators are used in smart medical devices to collect data about the human body, which is then sent to the fog layer for analysis. However, H-IoT devices present security and Quality of Service (QoS) concerns because of their critical nature, complexity, and dynamic features, which make them incompatible with conventional network topologies. Furthermore, reducing superfluous data and identifying effective fog nodes are difficult tasks. We provide a novel Software-Defined Networking (SDN)- driven Deep Learning (DL) approach to develop a secure, intelligent, and efficient framework for smart H-CIoT networks in order to address the aforementioned challenges. In this method, we have first considered SDN architecture as a promising solution since it allows for reconfiguration over static network infrastructure and manages the distributed architecture of intelligent H-CIoT networks by keeping the data and control planes apart. Secondly, a security module based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) is implemented to recognize various forms of attacks within the H-CIoT network. Third, the past medical records of the patients are used to train the DL model. It then makes an informed decision about whether to send the data to the fog layer.

However, such applications are computation-intensive and energy-consuming, imposing great difficulties to edge servers with limited computing resources, energy supply, and cooling capabilities. To reduce delay and energy consumption in edge, efficient microservice orchestration is necessary, but significantly challenging. Due to frequent communications among multiple microservices, service deployment and request routing are tightly-coupled, which motivates a complex joint optimization problem. When considering multi-instance modeling and fine-grained orchestration for massive microservices, the difficulty is extremely enlarged. Nevertheless, previous work failed to address the above difficulties. Also, they neglected to balance delay and energy, especially lacking dynamic energy-saving abilities. Therefore, this paper minimizes energy and delay by jointly optimizing microservice deployment and request routing via multi-instance modeling, fine-grained orchestration, and dynamic adaptation. Our queuing network model enables accurate end-to-end time analysis covering queuing, computing, and communicating delays. We then propose a delay-aware reinforcement learning algorithm, which derives the static service deployment and routing decisions. Moreover, we design an energy-aware dynamic frequency scaling algorithm, which saves energy with fluctuating request patterns. Experiment results demonstrate that our approaches significantly outperform baseline algorithms in both delay and energy consumption.  © 1968-2012 IEEE.","dynamic voltage frequency scaling; Edge computing; queuing theory; reinforcement learning; service orchestration","Delay tolerant networks; Delay-sensitive applications; Dynamic frequency scaling; Edge computing; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Finite automata; Learning algorithms; Queueing networks; Reinforcement learning; Voltage scaling; Delay aware; Dynamic voltage; Dynamic voltage frequency scaling; Edge computing; Frequency-scaling; Queuing theory; Reinforcement learnings; Routings; Service orchestration; Voltage frequency; Queueing theory","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216638444"

An optimal migration schedule should minimize the number of activated physical machines as well as maximize total internal invoking traffic (affinity).

However, the broad deployment of cloudlets poses challenges in efficient network slicing, particularly when traffic distribution is uneven. Therefore, these challenges include managing diverse resource requirements across widely distributed cloudlets, minimizing resource conflicts and delays, and maintaining service quality amid fluctuating request rates. Addressing this requires intelligent strategies to predict request types (common or urgent), assess resource needs, and allocate resources efficiently. Emerging technologies like edge computing and 5G with network slicing can handle delay-sensitive IoT requests rapidly, but a robust mechanism for real-time resource and utility optimization remains necessary. To address these challenges, we designed an end-to-end network slicing approach that predicts common and urgent user requests through T distribution. We formulated our problem as a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP) and introduced a multi-agent soft actor–critic (MAgSAC) algorithm. This algorithm prevents the wastage of scarce resources by intelligently activating and deactivating virtual network function (VNF) instances, thereby balancing the allocation process. Our approach aims to optimize overall utility, balancing trade-offs between revenue, energy consumption costs, and latency. We evaluated our method, MAgSAC, through simulations, comparing it with the following six benchmark schemes: MAA3C, SACT, DDPG, S2Vec, Random, and Greedy. The results demonstrate that our approach, MAgSAC, optimizes utility by 30%, minimizes energy consumption costs by 12.4%, and reduces execution time by 21.7% compared to the closest related multi-agent approach named MAA3C. © 2024 by the authors.","deep reinforcement learning (DRL); end-to-end network slicing; Internet of Things (IoT); mobile edge computing (MEC); multi-agent; utility optimization","5G mobile communication systems; Deep learning; Deep reinforcement learning; Health risks; Markov processes; Mobile edge computing; Network function virtualization; Reinforcement learning; Resource allocation; Deep reinforcement learning; Edge computing; End-to-end network; End-to-end network slicing; Internet of thing; Mobile edge computing; Multi agent; Network slicing; Reinforcement learnings; Utility optimizations; algorithm; article; benchmarking; deep reinforcement learning; energy consumption; human; internet of things; Markov decision process; simulation; Quality of service","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203879202"

The massive amount of data generated from the smart devices need to be transmitted, analyzed, and processed. This requires seamless data exchanges among geo-separated nodes, which results in a considerable burden on the underlying network infrastructure and can degrade the performance of any implemented solution. Therefore, a dynamic, agile, and programmable network management paradigm is required. To handle the challenges mentioned above, software-defined networking (SDN) gained much attention from academia, researchers, and industrial sectors. Shifting the computational load from forwarding devices to a logically centralized controller is a dream of every network operator who wants to have complete control and global visibility of the network. Also, the concept of network functions virtualization (NFV) in SDN controller is required to increase resource utilization efficiency. Thus, in this paper, a comprehensive survey on SDN for various smart applications is presented. This survey covers the infrastructural details of SDN hardware and OpenFlow switches, controllers, simulation tools, programming languages, open issues, and challenges in SDN implementation with advanced technologies such as 5G and microservices. In addition, the challenges on the control plane and data plane are highlighted in detail, such as fault tolerance, routing, scheduling of flows, and energy consumption on OpenFlow switches.

Industrial practitioners perceive the importance of applying architectural patterns but they struggle to quantify their impact on system quality requirements. Our research aims to quantify the effect of design patterns on system performance metrics, e.g., service latency and resource utilization, even more so when the patterns operate in real-world environments subject to heterogeneous workloads. We built a cloud infrastructure to host a well-established benchmark system that represents our test bed, complemented by the implementation of three design patterns: Gateway Aggregation, Gateway Offloading, Pipe and Filters. Real performance measurements are collected and compared with model-based predictions that we derived as part of our previous research, thus further consolidating the actual impact of these patterns. Our results demonstrate that, despite the difficulty to parameterize our benchmark system, model-based predictions are in line with real experimentation, since the performance behaviors of patterns, e.g., bottleneck switches, are mostly preserved. In summary, this is the first work that experimentally demonstrates the performance behavior of microservices-based architectural patterns.

These internet-connected gadgets lack the necessary capacity, resources, and storage to effectively process and retain large volumes of data with accuracy and reliability. Therefore, it is vital to regulate and process the unpredictable data created by a computing paradigm with robust resource specifications. Cloud computing has been considered an appealing solution for effectively analyzing and storing this data within a specific timeframe. Furthermore, the existence of multiple conflicting factors and the classification of the problem as NP-hard make resource management and task consolidation major obstacles in Cloud-based systems. This research suggests a hybrid Resource Monitoring, Task Scheduling and Migration technique that combines an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) with a Binary Quantum-based Avian Navigation Optimizer technique (BQANA) to tackle these challenges. The BQANA algorithm is utilized to enhance the control parameters of the ANFIS system. Additionally, a load balancing technique is proposed to provide an even distribution of workloads among Cloud Virtual Machines (VMs) to optimize resource management. Furthermore, a task migration strategy has also been adopted to offload the overloaded tasks to under-utilized VMs. The proposed approach presented in this study has been thoroughly validated using extensive simulations on real-world benchmark datasets, specifically for Quality of Service (QoS) characteristics.

Adaptive elastic scaling of resources can significantly improve system energy efficiency and reduce operation overhead: on the one hand, service resources can be expanded to cope with high demand during high load; and on the other hand, they can be scaled down to reduce the overhead during low load. However, the actual load is usually highly volatile, and the service resources required to satisfy the quality of service are constantly varying, which poses a great challenge to the adaptive elastic scaling of service resources. Although existing commercial distributed platforms generally have some resource elastic scaling capability, they suffer from limited adaptive ability and poor precision, and there exists a considerable improvement space. In order to promote the research and application development in this field, this paper analyzes the studies on adaptive elastic scaling of service resources in this environment. Firstly, the corresponding research background and main challenges in demand evaluation and resource adjustment are analyzed. Secondly, a categorized survey of domestic and international studies in this field is conducted, by dividing these studies into three categories based on the resource objects they adjust.

However, to maintain applications’ efficiency, their deployment in the Computing Continuum has to be continuously adapted to the varying load of different nodes of the network. In practice, existing support frameworks allow developers to automatically identify how to deploy applications based on the infrastructure status. However, as the application takes time to be deployed, the chosen deployment is outdated once it is applied through the network, as workloads change over time. To address this practical engineering challenge and plan deployments that foresee changes in energy consumption and workload, predictive solutions are needed. To fulfill this need, this work presents the Microservice Energy consumption and Workload Forecaster (MEWF), a prediction system that leverages artificial intelligence techniques to precisely predict CPU usage and energy consumption in varying circumstances. Our practical evaluation over multiple real microservices shows that MEWF improves prediction precision by up to 55% w.r.t. state-of-the-art benchmarks, enabling efficient resource management and demonstrating significant value for real-world deployments. © 2025","Artificial Intelligence; Computing Continuum; Energy consumption; Microservices; Workload prediction","Change-over time; Computing continuum; Distributed infrastructure; Edge nodes; Energy consumption prediction; Energy-consumption; Improving performance; Microservice; Varying load; Workload predictions","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216566548"

Nevertheless, radar data frequently exhibit anomalies, including gaps and clutter, arising from atmospheric refraction, equipment malfunctions, and other factors, resulting in diminished data quality. Traditional radar blockage correction methods, such as employing approximate radial information interpolation and supplementing missing data, often fail to effectively exploit potential patterns in massive radar data, for the large volume of data precludes a thorough analysis and understanding of the inherent complex patterns and dependencies through simple interpolation or supplementation techniques. Fortunately, edge computing possesses certain data processing capabilities and cloud center boasts substantial computational power, which together can collaboratively offer timely computation and storage for the correction of radar beam blockage. To this end, an edge-cloud collaborative driven deep learning model named DenMerD is proposed in this paper, which includes dense connection module and merge distribution (MD) unit. Compared to existing models such as RC-FCN, DenseNet, and VGG, this model greatly improves key performance metrics, with 30.7 (Formula presented.) improvement in Critical Success Index (CSI), 30.1 (Formula presented.) improvement in Probability of Detection (POD), and 3.1 (Formula presented.) improvement in False Alarm Rate (FAR). It also performs well in the Structure Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) metrics compared to its counterparts. These findings underscore the efficacy of the design in improving feature propagation and beam blockage accuracy, and also highlights the potential and value of mobile edge computing in processing large-scale meteorological data. © The Author(s) 2024.","Deep learning; Image restoration; Mobile edge computing; Radar beam blockage correction","Data handling; Deep learning; Digital storage; Image enhancement; Interpolation; Meteorology; Mobile edge computing; Blockage correction; Cloud-computing; Deep learning; Early warning; Edge clouds; Radar beam; Radar beam blockage correction; Radar data; Radar network; Weather phenomena; Image reconstruction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184368036"

Burst tasks, such as faults and data requests from the cloud, can occur at any time for edge computing devices in distribution networks. These tasks are unpredictable and usually hold the highest priority and must be completed as soon as possible. Although resources can be reserved partially at each period in the pre-scheduled operation plan, they may still be insufficient to handle burst tasks adequately. A real-time resource dispatch approach for burst tasks is developed in this study to address the above problems. The concept of flexibility for edge computing devices is presented, determining the real-time dispatch duration. Real-time resource dispatch and task handling processing are analyzed in detail, considered as task real-time dispatch models, computation process real-time dispatch constraints, and resource limitation constraints. The proposed real-time resource dispatch approach takes full advantage of the transferable characteristics for partial original plan tasks to adjust the pre-scheduled operation plan and release flexible resources for immediate processing of the burst task, completing burst tasks quickly and minimizing the impact for previous planned tasks on the edge computing device. The capability of the proposed method to efficiently deal with the burst tasks is also verified by the case study. © 2024 by the authors.","burst tasks; digital distribution network; edge computing; real-time processing mechanism; resource rescheduling","Data handling; Digital devices; Burst task; Computing devices; Digital distribution; Digital distribution network; Edge computing; Real- time; Real-time processing mechanism; Realtime processing; Resource dispatch; Resource rescheduling; Edge computing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199653538"

These applications have generated massive amounts of sensory data. Uploading the data to cloud servers consumes a significant amount of communication bandwidth, placing immense pressure on network channels and cloud resources. Moreover, the data process cannot meet the real-time requirements of these applications. To address these issues, the concept of edge intelligence to PIoT has emerged. By combining edge computing with artificial intelligence, edge intelligence to PIoT uses AI algorithms to perform preprocessing, local computation, and inference near the data source. This approach reduces the communication bandwidth, and decreases transmission latency and power consumption. Edge Intelligence to PIoT provides an effective solution to the above problems. This article first explains the concept and evolution of edge intelligence to PIoT. Then, the architecture of edge intelligence in smart grid IoT is proposed, and the hardware and software foundations of edge intelligence to PIoT are analyzed from three levels: edge-side AI chips, edge computing operating systems, and edge computing frameworks. Next, key technologies in edge intelligence to PIoT are discussed from five aspects: cloud-edge collaboration, model compression, model acceleration, swarm intelligence, and federated learning. Furthermore, application scenarios for edge intelligence to PIoT are explored in the five aspects of “generation, transmission, transformation, distribution, and utilization”.

These applications are often built using microservices, an architectural style where the application is composed of independently deployable services focusing on specific functionalities. Mobile devices cannot process these microservices locally, so traditionally, cloud-based frameworks using cost-efficient Virtual Machines (VMs) and edge servers have been used to offload these tasks. However, cloud frameworks suffer from extended boot times and high transmission overhead, while edge servers have limited computational resources. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a Microservices Container-Based Mobile Edge Cloud Computing (MCBMEC) environment and proposes an innovative framework, Optimization Task Scheduling and Computational Offloading with Cost Awareness (OTSCOCA). This framework addresses Resource Matching, Task Sequencing, and Task Scheduling to enhance server utilization, reduce service latency, and improve service bootup times. Empirical results validate the efficacy of MCBMEC and OTSCOCA, demonstrating significant improvements in server efficiency, reduced service latency, faster service bootup times, and notable cost savings.

In this study, the training performances of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) developed to determine the nuclear reactor channel temperature with different hyperparameter combinations were analysed. It was conducted several experimental studies to assess the influence of hyperparameters on our model for nuclear reactor parameter data prediction. The training and validation results indicates that learning rate, hidden layer sizes and number have critical effects for the more precisive prediction. It was observed that models with a learning rate of 0.05 and 0.5 achieved successful learning with less fluctuation in training and validation errors. When looking at hidden layer sizes, networks with 32 and 64 neurons performed better than networks with 16 neurons.

Among these are augmented reality, online interactive gaming, and real-time video processing, all of which arc characterized by their sensitivity to latency. The quality of servicc (QoS) demands for these applications arc stringent, necessitating precisc control over geospatial positioning, response times, energy efficiency, and other resource-intensive constraints. IoT devices, which are integral to the functioning of these applications, encapsulate a variety of functionalities through IoT services. The fulfillment of user requests often hinges on the seamless composition of these data and computation-intensive services. However, the resource limitations inherent to IoT devices pose a significant challenge. The dynamic allocation and deallocation of resources during the runtime of IoT services lead to fluctuations in the availability of these resources within edge networks. Given the difficulty in replenishing IoT device resources and the potential for substantial variability in their consumption, the risk of device overload is a genuine concern. This can result in a decline in the ability of IoT services to consistently meet user requests, thereby degrading the QoS for both current and future requests. This paper introduces a novel low-cost service reconfiguration strategy designed to mitigate the imbalance of resources in edge computing environments. By leveraging service migration technologies, we propose a resource-efficient reconfiguration method capable of accommodating a greater number of forthcoming user requests, all while adhering to specified QoS constraints. We formulate the service reconfiguration problem as markov multi-phases decisions, which are addressed by Double Q-network with the replay buffer to enhance Reinforcement Learning (denoted DQRL). This algorithm considers the delay of IoT applications and resource utilization of IoT devices comprehensively, to optimize service reconfiguration in edge networks. The proposed strategy is underpinned by an intelligent deci- sion-making framework that optimizes the allocation of resources to IoT services, thereby enhancing the resilience and adaptability of edge networks to fluctuating demands. To validate the efficacy of our approach, we conducted extensive experiments using a dataset from Shanghai telecom base stations, which provided a realistic and complex environment for testing. The experimental results show that our approach performs better than baseline techniques in terms of satisfying delay constraints of IoT applications, decreasing energy consumption, and improving the resource utilization efficiency of IoT devices. This performance not only contributes to the sustainability of IoT ecosystems but also enhances the overall resource utilization efficiency of IoT devices. © 2024 Science Press.

Through machine learning (ML) algorithms, online time series classification in IoMT systems enables reliable real-time disease detection. Deploying ML algorithms on edge health devices can reduce latency and safeguard patients’ privacy. However, the limited computational resources of these devices underscore the need for more energy-efficient algorithms. Furthermore, online time series classification inevitably faces the challenges of concept drift (CD) and catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these challenges, this study proposes an energy-efficient Online Time series classification algorithm that can solve CF and CD for health devices, called OTCD. Methods: OTCD first detects the appearance of concept drift and performs prototype updates to mitigate its impact. Afterward, it standardizes the potential space distribution and selectively preserves key training parameters to address CF. This approach reduces the required memory and enhances energy efficiency. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model in real-time health monitoring tasks, we utilize electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) data. By adopting various feature extractors, three arrhythmia classification models are compared. To assess the energy efficiency of OTCD, we conduct runtime tests on each dataset. Additionally, the OTCD is compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) dynamic time series classification models for performance evaluation. Results: The OTCD algorithm outperforms existing SOTA time series classification algorithms in IoMT. In particular, OTCD is on average 2.77% to 14.74% more accurate than other models on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset. Additionally, it consumes low memory (1 KB) and performs computations at a rate of 0.004 GFLOPs per second, leading to energy savings and high time efficiency. Conclusion: Our proposed algorithm, OTCD, enables efficient real-time classification of medical time series on edge health devices. Experimental results demonstrate its significant competitiveness, offering promising prospects for safe and reliable healthcare. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Catastrophic forgetting; Concept drift; Edge health devices; Sensor time series classification; Smart healthcare","Algorithms; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Electrocardiography; Humans; Internet of Things; Machine Learning; Monitoring, Physiologic; Photoplethysmography; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Computational efficiency; Diseases; Electrocardiography; Health care; Machine learning; Online systems; Real time systems; Statistical tests; Time series; Catastrophic forgetting; Concept drifts; Edge health device; Energy efficient; Machine learning algorithms; Online time; Real- time; Sensor time series classification; Smart healthcare; Time series classifications; Article; classification algorithm; comparative study; controlled study; convolutional neural network; diagnostic accuracy; electrocardiogram; energy consumption; feature selection; heart arrhythmia; heart supraventricular arrhythmia; human; internet of things; mean squared error; memory consolidation; phonocardiography; photoelectric plethysmography; recurrent neural network; time series analysis; algorithm; classification; devices; diagnosis; electrocardiography; internet of things; machine learning; physiologic monitoring; procedures; signal processing; Energy efficiency","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195595665"

Flexible and sustainable system development models emphasizing energy efficiency can help innovate software development as digital servicing applications shift. This research is motivated by the need to improve energy consumption in early software design and development due to rising technological efficiency and sustainability demands. Although effective in iterative development and stakeholder engagement, traditional Agile methodologies often struggle with long-term sustainability and energy efficiency. Extended Agile, combining Agile, layered architecture, and aspect-oriented frameworks (ALAI), promises to improve system modularity, flexibility, maintainability, and sustainability. This study’s findings are not just theoretical, but also practically relevant, as they explore the energy efficiency of ALAI software development methodologies, using graduate admission information system services (GAISS) as an example. GAISS is a complex system that handles the entire process of graduate admissions, from application submission to final decision. The study quantifies the energy usage of a student-list webpage by analyzing Microsoft IIS server logs from February 2022 to May 2024. Directly applicable findings show that the GAISS based on the ALAI framework reduces energy consumption by 10.7914% compared to traditional Agile software developments. ALAI used 892.80 kWh versus Agile’s 1000.80 kWh during operations, saving energy. These findings demonstrate the benefits of integrating aspect-oriented frameworks and layering approaches into Agile methodologies, contributing to sustainable software development discourse. The study emphasizes the importance of energy-efficient frameworks such as ALAI to reduce software systems’ environmental impact and promote software development sustainability. The findings of this study, with their practical relevance, assist software developers and organizations in choosing software design and development methods that maximize operational efficiency and environmental sustainability. © 2024 by the authors.","agile; aspect-oriented; energy efficiency; flexibility; framework; layering; software development; sustainability","business development; energy efficiency; environmental impact; information system; software; stakeholder; sustainability; sustainable development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198449600"

Considering the impact of computation services on offloading efficiency, there are several works that jointly study the decision making of task offloading and service caching. However, the existing works fail to consider the time-varying service requests and ignore the time-slots correlation of the computation services. To bridge the gap, this work designs a service-aware parallel task offloading approach, which is the first work to jointly explore time-varying computation services and task offloading based on real-world vehicular trajectory data in VEC networks. Specifically, we first propose a computation service prediction algorithm using the real-world vehicular trajectory data. Guided by this, RSUs flexibly precache computation services. Then, we propose a learning-based parallel task offloading algorithm, which allows vehicles to make offloading decisions based on the history of the edge selections. Furthermore, we conduct simulations to validate the proposed algorithm. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces task delay by 45%, 58%, and 55% compared to the algorithms without service-aware computation offloading under various CPU cycles, task numbers, and time slots.  © 2014 IEEE.","Computation offloading; online learning; service caching; service prediction; vehicular edge computing (VEC)","Vehicular ad hoc networks; Computation offloading; Computation service; Edge computing; Online learning; Parallel task; Service caching; Service prediction; Service-aware; Task offloading; Vehicular edge computing; Computation offloading","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207131730"

Traditional edge computing solutions have proven to be insufficient in fulfilling the demanding prerequisites of low latency and high data rates. Additionally, publicly available edge cloud solutions fail to meet the required standards for ensuring privacy protection. Consequently, Private Edge Cloud Systems (PECSs) have garnered attention as a prospective solution owing to their capacity to mitigate privacy risks and their significant computing capacity. PECS research has seen significant growth, but there is a lack of detailed review of its issues, approaches, and applications in the literature. To explore the potential application value of PECS, this paper provides a systematic review of intelligent platforms and architecture for PECSs. Specifically, an overview of the fundamental characteristics of PECSs is provided.

Strategies include deploying distributed and optimized Deep Neural Networks on mobile devices, which can lead to considerable energy consumption and degraded performance, or offloading larger models to edge servers, which requires low-latency wireless channels. Here we present Furcifer, a novel middleware that autonomously adjusts the computing strategy (i.e., local computing, edge computing, or split computing) based on context conditions. Utilizing container-based services and low-complexity predictors that generalize across environments, Furcifer supports supervised compression as a viable alternative to pure local or remote processing in real-time environments. An extensive set of experiments coversdiverse scenarios, including both stable and highly dynamic channel environments with unpredictable changes in connection quality and load. In moderate-varying scenarios, Furcifer demonstrates significant benefits: achieving a 2x reduction in energy consumption, a 30% higher mean Average Precision score compared to local computing, and a three-fold FPS increase over static offloading. In highly dynamic environments with unreliable connectivity and rapid increases in concurrent clients, Furcifer's predictive capabilities preserves up to 30% energy, achieving a 16% higher accuracy rate, and completing 80% more frame inferences compared to pure local computing and approaches without trend forecasting, respectively. © 2025 The Authors","Edge computing; Energy efficiency; Image compression; Machine learning; Middleware; Object detection; Split computing","Computation offloading; Deep neural networks; Image compression; Mobile edge computing; Edge computing; Energy; Images compression; Machine-learning; Neural networks algorithms; Neural-networks; Objects detection; Real- time; Real-world; Split computing; Middleware","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218423854"

Researchers have long been interested in the classification problem of electric power anomaly detection. Anomaly detection can stop little issues from snowballing into unmanageable issues. In addition, it helps cut down on energy waste. Existing anomaly detection models mostly ignore the spatial attribute of electricity consumption data. They would primarily emphasize the time series information contained within the energy consumption data. Furthermore, the trace has the ability to precisely reconstruct consumer pathways; the smart grid can thus use it to detect anomalies. To fill this research gap, we propose a trace-based graph deep learning model to detect anomalous consumers in the smart grid. An unsupervised encoder–decoder is used in the proposed model. First, our model combines traces using an efficient unified graph representation and provides quality scores. Then, the long short-term memory network extracts the temporal attributes, while the graph neural network extracts the spatial attributes. Finally, it computes the anomaly score by adding two hyper-parameters with two-part loss values. We conducted experiments on power consumption data that was gathered from an open-source dataset. The proposed model performs better than a range of standard anomaly detection models. The F1-score of our model is 94.60%, and the AUC is 98.90%. Experiments show that our model is stable even in extreme data imbalance. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Anomaly detection; Energy consumption; Graph neural network; Spatio-temporal learning","Deep learning; Electric power utilization; Graph neural networks; Learning systems; Smart power grids; Anomaly detection; Anomaly detection models; Electric power; Energy wastes; Energy-consumption; Graph neural networks; Learning models; Smart grid; Spatial attribute; Spatio-temporal learning; Anomaly detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188325172"

Consequently, researchers have promoted the development of sustainable software with new development methods and tools to lessen its hardware demands. However, the approaches developed so far lack cohesiveness along the stages of the software development life cycle (SDLC) and exist outside of a holistic method for green software development (GSD). In addition, there is a severe lack of approaches that target the analysis and design stages of the SDLC, leaving software architects and designers unsupported. In this article, we introduce our behavior-based consumption profile (BBCP) external Domain-Specific Language (DSL), aimed at assisting software architects and designers in modeling the behavior of software. The models generated with our external DSL contain multiple sets of properties that characterize features of the software’s behavior. In contrast to other modeling languages, our BBCP emphasizes how time and probability are involved in software execution and its evolution over time, helping its users to gather an expectation of software usage and hardware consumption from the initial stages of software development. To illustrate the feasibility and benefits of our proposal, we conclude with an analysis of the model of a software service created using the BBCP, which is simulated using Insight Maker to obtain an estimation of hardware consumption and later translated to energy consumption. © 2024 by the authors.","behavior with software; green software; SOA; software behavior; software engineering; software profiling","Program translators; Software design; Behavior with software; Behavior-based; Energy-consumption; Green software; SOA; Software architects; Software behavior; Software development life-cycle; Software execution; Software profiling; Green development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203852902"

One possible way to achieve these objectives is to minimize the number of active nodes in order to avoid resource fragmentation and unnecessary energy consumption. This paper presents a Distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Capacity-Aware Application Placement (DDRL-CAAP) approach aimed at reducing the number of active nodes in a multi-MEC system scenario that is managed by several orchestrators.

Nevertheless, the workflow resource requirements, such as lowering makespan and energy meeting delay constraints, were not met by the current cloud-based resource provisioning model. Although multi-cloud platforms have shown to be an effective means of cutting costs and enhancing performance efficiency, they are unable to satisfy the demands of complex workflows that are sensitive to delays. Although edge-cloud platforms have been utilized to reduce delay, overall performance is affected by the dynamic changes in workflow quality of service (QoS). Server scaling has been accomplished to meet application dynamic requirements by using efficient virtual network function (VNF) placement that ensures reliability; however, current work has not reduced energy consumption while optimizing VNF based on a simple workflow devoid of task interdependencies. In overcoming the research shortcoming, this paper introduces an energy and performance-aware workflow scheduler (EPAWS) for edge-cloud platforms; the EPAWS introduces an efficient VNF placement and service function chain (SFC) optimization for execution of scientific workflow in edge-cloud platforms. Simulation outcome shows the EPAWS is very efficient in reducing makespan by 97.7%, 97.4%, and 87.29% for Inspiral workflow, 87.46%, 65.86%, and 49.83% for CyberShake workflow and energy consumption by 91.5%, 71.62%, and 52.2% for Inspiral workflow, 96.63%, 94.6%, and 90.39% for CyberShake workflow in comparison with baseline models such as energy-aware adaptive-scaling (EAAS), reliability- enhancement strategy for workflow scheduler (RESWS), and multi-objective resource optimized workflow scheduler (MOROWS), respectively. © 2025","Directed acyclic graph; Edge-cloud; Energy efficiency; Scientific workflow; Service function chain; Virtual network function","Network function virtualization; Quality of service; Acyclic graphs; Directed acyclic graph; Edge clouds; Energy; Network functions; Scientific workflows; Service function chain; Service functions; Virtual network function; Virtual networks; Cloud platforms","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215938352"

However, existing studies often assume all attacks coincide, focusing on cascading failures from a single perspective while neglecting specific attack strategies. This study is the first to apply sequential attack strategies to WMNs and conduct a comparative analysis with synchronous strategies. First, we propose a system model for WMNs that incorporates path loss and link capacity, representing real-world scenarios. Secondly, we introduce two novel reliability metrics, transmission reliability and reliability degradation rate, to quantify the impact of attacks. In the final case study, we analyze the effects of synchronous and sequential attack strategies under four node attack rules. Results reveal that sequential attack strategies dynamically identify and exploit critical nodes, causing prolonged degradation of transmission reliability and amplifying cascading failures. Compared to synchronous attack strategies, sequential attack strategies increase the global reliability degradation rate and reliability degradation rate during the attack phase by 28.62 % and 55.36 %, respectively. Therefore, sequential attack strategies should combine these two node attack rules to achieve maximum impact. These findings confirm that the proposed sequential attack strategy effectively disrupts network performance and provides meaningful insights for developing WMN defense strategies. © 2025","Attack strategies; Cascading failure; Reliability; Wireless Mesh Network","Mesh generation; Reliability analysis; Wireless mesh networks (WMN); Attack strategies; Cascading failures; Degradation rate; Interdependent systems; MeshNetworks; Modern infrastructure; Reliability degradation; Transmission reliability; Wireless mesh; Wireless mesh network; MESH networking","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215395988"

However, there’s a lack of IIoT platforms dedicated to IR O&M, including IR maintenance, process optimization, and knowledge sharing. In this context, this paper puts forward the multi-tenant-oriented ACbot platform, which attempts to provide the first holistic IIoT-based solution for O&M of IRs.

Later, container workloads based on Docker and Podman were orchestrated via Kubernetes or OpenShift. On the other hand, high-performance computing (HPC) environments have been lagging in this process, as much work is still needed to figure out how to apply containerization platforms for HPC. Containers have many advantages, as they tend to have less overhead while providing flexibility, modularity, and maintenance benefits. This makes them well-suited for tasks requiring a lot of computing power that are latency- or bandwidth-sensitive. But they are complex to manage, and many daily operations are based on command-line procedures that take years to master. This paper proposes a different architecture based on seamless hardware integration and a user-friendly UI (User Interface). It also offers dynamic workload placement based on real-time performance analysis and prediction and Machine Learning-based scheduling. This solves a prevalent issue in Kubernetes: the suboptimal placement of workloads without needing individual workload schedulers, as they are challenging to write and require much time to debug and test properly. It also enables us to focus on one of the key HPC issues—energy efficiency. Furthermore, the application we developed that implements this architecture helps with the Kubernetes installation process, which is fully automated, no matter which hardware platform we use—x86, ARM, and soon, RISC-V. The results we achieved using this architecture and application are very promising in two areas—the speed of workload scheduling and workload placement on a correct node. This also enables us to focus on one of the key HPC issues—energy efficiency. © 2024 by the authors.","data center architecture; dynamic performance evaluation; hardware and software integration; high-performance computing; Kubernetes","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198497070"

Fog computing tackles a range of challenges, including processing, storage, bandwidth, latency, and reliability, by locally distributing secure information through end nodes. Consisting of endpoints, fog nodes, and back-end cloud infrastructure, it provides advanced capabilities beyond traditional cloud computing. In smart environments, particularly within smart city transportation systems, the abundance of devices and nodes poses significant challenges related to power consumption and system reliability. To address the challenges of latency, energy consumption, and fault tolerance in these environments, this paper proposes a latency-aware, fault-tolerant framework for resource scheduling and data management, referred to as the FORD framework, for smart cities in fog environments. This framework is designed to meet the demands of time-sensitive applications, such as those in smart transportation systems. The FORD framework incorporates latency-aware resource scheduling to optimize task execution in smart city environments, leveraging resources from both fog and cloud environments. Through simulation-based executions, tasks are allocated to the nearest available nodes with minimum latency. In the event of execution failure, a fault-tolerant mechanism is employed to ensure the successful completion of tasks. Upon successful execution, data is efficiently stored in the cloud data center, ensuring data integrity and reliability within the smart city ecosystem. © 2025 The Authors.

The actuation industry is an important sector for converting energy into mechanical motion, and it is currently undergoing an evolutionary change. Actuators are significant elements that connect digital systems to physical infrastructure. Actuators allow for automation, control, and optimization of operations in smart cities. Conventional actuators are characterized by imperfections in terms of performance, agility, and real-time monitoring. Accordingly, this article presents an innovative actuator design that outperforms existing actuators in terms of performance, reliability, and scalability. We designed the novel actuator to incorporate multiple sensors and devices, including force, vibration, temperature, and position sensors. This design is intelligent and performs very well in real-time collection, processing, and analysis of data. It has the ability to integrate with a cloud-based platform. Such connections make it possible for remote monitoring, management, and human-centric security in smart cities through object detection. The proposed design optimizes the performance of actuator and makes adjustments where necessary. The proposed actuator design employs idealized design principles, control systems, and high-strength materials. It helps achieve a longer life cycle and a high level of robustness in demanding industrial conditions. Smart control algorithms incorporate dynamic force control, adaptive speed regulation, and precision of positioning. They also find applications in diverse solutions, such as regulating valves and robotics. This study also highlights the vital role of renewable energy sources, smart grids, and energy efficiency in the creation of a sustainable and optimized energy ecosystem for smart cities. IoT-based actuators with intelligent designs improve the performance, efficiency, and reliability of actuation in smart cities with real-time monitoring.

Workflow scheduling involves finding an optimal schedule for a group of sub-tasks while maintaining dependency constraints. It is also a non-deterministic polynomial (NP)-complete problem. One of the most challenging aspects of scheduling workflow applications is generating a valid sequence of execution while adhering to dependency constraints among all sub-tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-effective workflow scheduling algorithm based on Quantum-Inspired Particle Swarm Optimization (QIPSO), termed QIPSO-WSA. This algorithm addresses the challenges of efficiently scheduling workflows while optimizing energy consumption. It leverages concepts from QIPSO to enhance the scheduling process and achieve energy efficiency in edge computing environments. QIPSO-WSA considers several critical factors, including makespan, energy consumption, and resource utilization. Quantum particles (QPs) are generated using quantum bits and are updated using a quantum angle. The QPs are decoded using novel hashing techniques, and the fitness function is designed by incorporating various objectives. Extensive simulations are performed and compared with evolutionary techniques. Statistical analyses, including analysis of variance and the Friedman test, are conducted, and the Taguchi parametric statistical technique is applied to assess performance. The simulation results demonstrate that QIPSO-WSA outperforms existing approaches, achieving improvements in makespan by 11.11%, resource utilization by 5.79%, and energy consumption by 9.52%. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Edge computing; Energy consumption; Hashing; Quantum inspired particle swarm optimization; Quantum particles; Workflow scheduling","Computation offloading; Network security; Polynomial approximation; Quantum efficiency; Resource allocation; Scheduling algorithms; Computing environments; Edge computing; Energy-consumption; Hashing; Particle swarm; Quantum inspired particle swarm optimization; Quantum particles; Swarm optimization; Workflow applications; Workflow scheduling; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217398484"

An integral constituent is a communication between machines, between machines and humans, or between machines and products. This extensive communication involves large volumes of data. Many manufacturers apply data analytics (e.g., for quality management or improvement purposes) to translate the data into a business value. However, isolated, rigid, and area-specific IT solutions often carry this out. Today’s complex manufacturing requires quality management approaches that constitute a holistic view of and understanding of process–product interactions along the process chain instead of focusing solely on single processes. A novel platform approach to support quality management in manufacturing systems is proposed in this paper to overcome this deficit. It integrates state-of-the-art concepts of IT with modeling approaches for planning and operation of quality management. A conceptual framework and the technical architecture for implementing a digitalization platform are presented in this regard. Moreover, the approach is validated and implemented within a web application based on a use case of data-driven quality management in electronics production. © The Author(s) 2023.","Data analytics; Digital platform; Machine learning; Manufacturing system; Quality management","E-learning; Information management; Machine learning; Quality management; 'current; Business value; Data analytics; Data driven; Digital platforms; Digital transformation; Large volumes; Machine-learning; Multi-stage manufacturing systems; Technological trends; Data Analytics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163742508"

Today, one of the main challenges in networking is to organize an efficient TE system that will provide such parameters of quality of service (QoS) as the allowable value of packet loss and time for traffic re-routing. Traditional one-way routing facilities do not provide the required quality of service (QoS) parameters for TE. Modern computer networks use static and dynamic routing algorithms, which are characterized by big time complexity and a large amount of service information. This negatively affects the overall state of the network, namely: leads to network congestion, device failure, loss of information during routing and increases the time for traffic re-routing. Research has shown that the most promising way to solve the TE problem in computer networks is a comprehensive approach, which consists of multi-path routing, SDN technology and monitoring of the overall situation of the network. This paper proposes a method of traffic engineering in a software-defined network with specified quality of service parameters, which has reduced the time of traffic re-routing and the percentage of packet loss due to the combination of the centralized TE method and multi-path routing. From a practical point of view, the obtained method, will improve the quality of service in computer networks in comparison with the known method of traffic construction. © 2024, Modern Education and Computer Science Press.

To build a multi-label classification (MLC) system that is both quick and efficient, one must consider the large data environment. This paper introduces a new MLC model, RR-IPLST (Ridge Regression-Principal Label Space Transformation), which uses a combination of ridge regression and original label space transformation (IPLST). The model includes Advanced Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structures (AOPLS) for optimal dimensionality reduction, increasing data set relevance. IPLST uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to identify label correlations, while RR mitigates multicollinearity problems. Unsupervised learning, especially the value learning method, refines label predictions. The proposed model is rigorously evaluated on ten diverse multi-label datasets and demonstrates its effectiveness. Support vector machine, simple Bayes polynomial, k nearest neighbor, decision trees, linear and discriminant analysis are five regularly used data set classification techniques whose outputs are compared.

There still lacks a practical and efficient indicator for production environments. This paper proposes INS, a cloud runtime system that can effectively detect the performance fluctuation of online cloud applications and reallocate resources to curb performance interference. It proposes INSPath as the new performance indicator to describe the degree of performance degradation and pinpoint the resource bottlenecks.

However, many IoT applications are constrained by communication paths prone to link failures, necessitating robust fault tolerance techniques to ensure reliable traffic flow. In particular, real-time IoT applications demand stringent reliability and bandwidth requirements (constraints), which are challenging to meet simultaneously. Although previous research has investigated SDN-based routing to improve reliability, developing a routing algorithm that satisfies both reliability and bandwidth constraints remains an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we propose two novel routing algorithms: Reliability Aware Bandwidth constrained Routing (RABR) and Reliability and Bandwidth Constrained Routing (RBCR), specifically designed for SDN-enabled environments. Our approach prioritizes service reliability while meeting strict reliability and bandwidth criteria. The proposed solution integrates several phases, including reliability aware and bandwidth constrained path routing and flow duplication through parallel/hybrid and sequential routing methods. Furthermore, we introduce a greedy heuristic algorithm, implemented by the SDN controller with an efficient time complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in critical metrics such as reliability, reliability-bandwidth success rate, and Runtime. As such, our solution emerges as a robust choice for SDN-enabled IoT environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Bandwidth; Fog computing; IoT applications; Reliability; SDN","Fault tolerance; Heuristic algorithms; Bandwidth-aware; Bandwidth-constrained routing; Communication path; Efficiency and reliability; Fault tolerance techniques; Internet of thing application; Link failures; Routings; Software-defined networkings; Traffic flow; Fog computing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218913785"

This has the effect of lowering bandwidth demand and transmission latency. Optimal edge server placement and allocation, as the first stage of MEC, can improve end-user service quality, edge computing system utility, and cost and energy consumption. The majority of previous edge server placement studies have employed only one objective or developed a fitness function by the weighted sum method for optimization. Usually, using a single optimization objective without considering other objectives cannot yield the desired results for a problem with a multi-objective design. On the other hand, assigning weights to objectives can lead to losing optimal points in non-convex problems and selecting improper weights. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a multi-objective solution for the positioning and allocation of edge servers for MEC services based on the NSGA-II algorithm. In this regard, we identify two workload variance and latency reduction objectives with extensive evaluations. The experimental evaluation of the results using real-world data reveals that solutions based on the NSGA-II yield superior convergence and diversity of Pareto front points compared to Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO), Multi-Objective Biogeography Based Optimization (MOBBO), and Adaptive Weighted Sum Method (AWSM). Additionally, it effectively mitigates workload variance on servers and exhibits an average latency reduction of 8.79% in comparison to the adaptive weighted-sum approach, 9.19% in comparison to MOPSO, and 0.28% in comparison to MOBBO. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024. corrected publication, 2024.","Edge server placement and allocation; Latency; Multi-objective optimization; Workload balance","Energy utilization; Green computing; Heuristic algorithms; Internet of things; Mobile edge computing; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Quality of service; Edge server; Edge server placement and allocation; Latency; Latency reduction; Multi objective; Multi objective particle swarm optimization; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimisations; Server placements; Workload balance; Multiobjective optimization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184926874"

To bridge this gap and bring essential services to rural populations, this paper leverages Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposal introduces a UAV-based network architecture and an energy-efficient algorithm to deploy Internet of Things (IoT) applications. These applications are broken down into microservices, strategically distributed among a subset of UAVs. This approach addresses the limitations associated with running an entire IoT application on a single UAV, which could lead to suboptimal outcomes due to battery and computational constraints. Simulation results conducted in a realistic scenario underscore the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

However, executing those containers can quickly become computationally expensive in constrained environments, given the limited CPU, memory, and energy resources in the Electric Control Units (ECU) of SDVA. Consequently, the efficient management of these containers is crucial for enabling the on-demand usage of the applications in the vehicle based on the available resources while considering several constraints and priorities, including failure tolerance, security, safety, and comfort. In this article, we propose a dynamic software container management approach for constrained environments such as embedded devices/ECUs in SDVA within smart cars. To address the conflicting objectives and constraints within the vehicle, we design a novel search-based approach based on multi-objective optimization. This approach facilitates the allocation, movement, or suspension of containers between ECUs in the cluster. Collaborating with our industry partner, Ford Motor Company, we evaluate our approach using different real-world software-defined scenarios. These scenarios involve using heterogeneous clusters of ECU devices in vehicles based on real-world software containers and use-case studies from the automotive industry. The experimental results demonstrate that our scheduler outperforms existing scheduling algorithms, including the default Docker scheduler -Spread- commonly used in automotive applications. Our proposed scheduler exhibits superior performance in terms of energy and resource cost efficiency. Specifically, it achieves a 35% reduction in energy consumption in power-saving mode compared to the scheduler employed by Ford Motor Company. Additionally, our scheduler effectively distributes workload among the ECUs in the cluster, minimizing resource usage, and dynamically adjusts to the real-time requirements and constraints of the car environment.

Addressing these hurdles, this paper advocates a fog-based smart agriculture infrastructure integrating edge computing and LoRa communication. We tackle farmers’ prime concern of animal intrusion by presenting a solution leveraging low-cost PIR sensors, cameras, and computer vision to detect intrusions and predict animal locations using an innovative algorithm. Our system detects intrusions pre-emptively, identifies intruders, forecasts their movements, and promptly alerts farmers.

M2C takes advantage of data from different modalities such as images, audio, and text and is able to achieve notable improvements in accuracy. However, achieving these accuracy gains often comes at the cost of increased computational complexity and energy consumption. Furthermore, the presence of numerous advanced sensors in these systems significantly contributes to power consumption, exacerbating the issue of limited power resources. Collectively, these challenges pose difficulties in deploying M2C on small embedded devices with scarce energy resources. In this article, we propose an Adaptive Modality Gating technique called AMG for in-situ M2C applications. The primary objective of AMG is to conserve energy while preserving the accuracy advantages of M2C. To achieve this goal, AMG incorporates two first-of-its-kind designs. Firstly, it introduces a novel semi-gating architecture that enables partial modality sensor power gating. Specifically, we devise the de-centralized AMG (D-AMG) and centralized AMG (C-AMG) architecture. The former buffers raw data on sensors while the latter buffers raw data on the computing board, which are suitable for different edge scenarios respectively. Secondly, it facilitates a self-initialization/tuning process on the AES, which is supported by carefully-built analytical model. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of AMG. It achieves a 1.6x to 3.8x throughput higher than other power management methods and improves the lifespan of AES by 10% to 280% longer within the same energy budget, while satisfying all performance and latency requirements across various scenarios. © 1968-2012 IEEE.","autonomous embedded systems; Edge AI; efficiency management; modality gating architecture; multi-modal DNNs","Adaptive modulation; Energy utilization; Advanced sensors; Autonomous embedded system; Edge AI; Efficiency managements; Embedded-system; Energy-consumption; Improving efficiency; Modality gating architecture; Multi-modal; Multi-modal DNN; Budget control","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209883016"

At the same time, it is necessary to automate both the design and operation of forecasting models in such services to keep pace with the increasing need for such locally adapted forecasts. Therefore, this paper proposes an automation level taxonomy to communicate the scope of automation in time series forecasting.

This research paper introduces an innovative approach to monitor the vital health parameters and overall health status of dairy cows through the development of an Internet of Things (IoT)-based neck collar device. This smart collar system incorporates a range of sensors for measuring temperature, pulse rate, and activity level. These sensors continuously collect data, which is wirelessly transmitted to a central database for real-time monitoring. Machine learning algorithms analyse these data to detect anomalies and patterns indicative of various health conditions. By enabling early disease detection, the IoT-based collar facilitates timely intervention, reducing the risk of cow morbidity and mortality, ultimately leading to enhanced milk production and overall herd health. In this paper, the design and architecture of the neck collar has been presented. The smart neck collar is characterized by low power consumption, miniaturization, intelligence, ease of operation, cost-effective new materials, portability, and high performance. By providing continuous and comprehensive monitoring, this technology significantly contributes to dairy cow welfare and farm operational efficiency. A comprehensive dataset containing vital health parameters of 150 dairy cows was collected over a period of two-months from seven districts in Punjab, India, including Fatehgarh Sahib, Ludhiana, Nawan Shahr, Patiala, Sangrur, Ropar, and Hoshiarpur, using smart neck collars. This dataset was analyzed using various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbor, Naïve Bayes, and Decision Trees.

In MEC environments, a software application typically consists of multiple micro-services, which can be composed together in a flexible manner to achieve various user requests. However, the composition of micro-services in MEC is still a challenging research issue arising from three aspects. Firstly, composite micro-services constructed by ignoring the processing capabilities of different micro-services may cause waste of edge resources. Secondly, edge servers' limitations in terms of computational power can easily cause service occupancy between composite micro-services, severely affecting the user experience. Thirdly, in dynamic and unstable mobile environments, different edge users have different sensitivities to request latency, which increases the complexity of micro-service composition. In order to improve edge resource utilization and user experience on micro-service invocations, in this paper, we comprehensively consider the above three factors, and we first model the micro-services composition problem in MEC as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem. Then, a micro-service composition optimization method M3C combining graph search and branch-and-bound strategy is proposed to find a composition solution set with low energy consumption and high success rate for multiple edge users. Finally, we perform a series of experiments on two widely used datasets.

As a result, the AI-as-a-service (AIaaS) model is experiencing rapid growth. Many of these AIaaS-based applications are not properly optimized initially. Once they start experiencing a large volume of traffic, different challenges start revealing themselves. One of these challenges is maintaining a profit margin for the sustainability of the AIaaS application-based business model, which depends on the proper utilization of computing resources. This paper introduces the resource award predictive (RAP) model for AIaaS cost optimization called RAP-Optimizer. It is developed by combining a deep neural network (DNN) with the simulated annealing optimization algorithm. It is designed to reduce resource underutilization and minimize the number of active hosts in cloud environments. It dynamically allocates resources and handles API requests efficiently. The RAP-Optimizer reduces the number of active physical hosts by an average of 5 per day, leading to a 45% decrease in server costs. The impact of the RAP-Optimizer was observed over a 12-month period. The observational data show a significant improvement in resource utilization. It effectively reduces operational costs from USD 2600 to USD 1250 per month. Furthermore, the RAP-Optimizer increases the profit margin by 179%, from USD 600 to USD 1675 per month. The inclusion of the dynamic dropout control (DDC) algorithm in the DNN training process mitigates overfitting, achieving a 97.48% validation accuracy and a validation loss of 2.82%. These results indicate that the RAP-Optimizer effectively enhances resource management and cost-efficiency in AIaaS applications, making it a valuable solution for modern cloud environments. © 2024 by the authors.","AIaaS; cloud resource optimization; cost-efficiency; deep neural network; dynamic dropout control; overfitting mitigation; profit margin enlarging; resource utilization; simulated annealing","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210290250"

Not to lose the advantages of each of them, there is a trend to load data centers by nesting containers in virtual machines. Although there are good experiences at a functional level, the performance and energy consumption trade-off of these solutions is not completely clear. Therefore, it is necessary to study how this new trend affects both energy consumption and performance.

However, the on-going shift to cloud-naive era does not necessarily mean energy efficiency. From the perspective of power management, co-hosted serverless functions are difficult to tame. They are lightweight, short-lived applications sensitive to power capping activities. In addition, they exhibit great individual and temporal variability, presenting idiosyncratic performance/power scaling goals that are often at odds with one another. To date, very few proposals exist in terms of tailored power management for serverless platforms. In this work, we introduce power synchronization, a novel yet generic mechanism for managing serverless functions in a power-efficient way. Our insight with power synchronization is that uniform application power behavior enables consistent and uncompromised function operation on shared host machines. We also propose PowerSync, a synchronization-based power management framework that ensures optimal efficiency based on a clear understanding of functions. Our evaluation shows that PowerSync can improve the energy efficiency of functions by up to 16% without performance loss compared to conventional power management strategies. © Science China Press 2024.","energy efficiency; power management; power synchronization; serverless computing; variability","Carbon neutralities; Design objectives; Energy; Mean energy; Power; Power constraints; Power synchronization; Serverless computing; Variability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211122285"

However, ensuring the correctness of scaling decisions and their impact on energy consumption is a challenging problem that has not been sufficiently addressed in previous research. Thus, in this paper, we present an innovative approach for analyzing host energy consumption and energy violations influenced by microservice autoscaling policies using probabilistic model checking (PMC). We propose four variations of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) models that incorporate various scaling constraints inspired by Kubernetes-based Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, and we encode these models using two different approaches, namely, bounded-by-action (BBA) and bounded-by-state (BBS). We use PMC to verify the scaling policies in terms of host energy consumption and energy violations, and we conduct sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of our models in generating energy-efficient scaling policies. Our results show that the latency and energy-based MDP model offers the most suitable policies for ensuring energy efficiency in microservice systems. Additionally, the number of pods and the scale-out action significantly affect energy consumption and violations. Sensitivity analysis also reveals that incorporating latency into scaling decisions is key to energy efficiency, while variations in the maximum pod threshold significantly influence energy consumption and violation. Our approach provides a formal method for ensuring the correctness of microservice autoscaling decisions in cloud environments at design time and can help reduce energy consumption and violations while ensuring service-level objectives are met. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Energy-driven microservice autoscaling; Formal verification; Kubernetes; Markov decision process; Microservices; Probabilistic model checking","Cloud computing; Energy efficiency; Formal verification; Health risks; Model checking; Program debugging; Sensitivity analysis; Autoscaling; Energy-consumption; Energy-driven; Energy-driven microservice autoscaling; Kubernetes; Markov Decision Processes; Microservice; Probabilistic model checking; Probabilistic model-checking; Scalings; Markov processes","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213696655"

This work focuses on performance modeling within FaaS-enabled distributed and decentralized edge environments, at both the node and function levels.

Its role in DSO is critical in providing feedback loops on system performance leading to desirable changes achieving long-term system and application sustainment. Containers are the de-facto deployed artifacts in DSO for diverse forms of systems and applications including AI models. Long-term sustainment of containerized AI models requires appropriate metrics for the successful maintenance of optimal container and model computing performance and correct model inference. There is no agreed upon set of metrics that should always be present when monitoring a deployed containerized AI model. The current literature and practice can benefit from a standard baseline of metrics for long-term monitoring of containerized AI models focused on computing and inference. In this paper, we propose a candidate baseline of metrics for consideration as a standard across PDM for any containerized AI model. We present a proof-of-concept (PoC) that implements a baseline of metrics for the continuous monitoring of an operationally deployed containerized AI model. The baseline represents the minimal metrics required for any containerized model deployed and actively operating to ensure successful long-term monitoring and support of optimal operation and performance. The metrics focus on container operation, model operation, and model inference. This paper also details the raw data required for the metrics along with a PoC which demonstrates container engineering for their acquisition. The paper illustrates the baseline as a mix of dynamic metrics that are customized for each problem class (e.g., object detection, regression) and data modality together with static metrics that should be present for any containerized model. The paper further shows that a containerized AI model can be engineered to produce these metrics and describes the benefits of a standardized baseline of metrics to aid in the reduction of power consumption in the global digital enterprise.  © 2024 Owner/Author.","AI; Artificial Intelligence; Container; Continuous Deployment; Deployment; DevOps; DevSecOps.; Machine Learning; Metrics; ML; Performance","Network security; Continuous deployment; Deployment; Devsecop.; Long term monitoring; Machine-learning; Metric; ML; Model inference; Performance; Proof of concept; DevOps","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204082104"

To address energy concerns, a prompt anomaly detection strategy is required on demand for troubleshooting resource-constrained IoT devices. It enables devices to adapt their configuration according to the dynamic signal quality and transmission settings. However, obtaining accurate energy data from IoT nodes without external devices is unfeasible. This paper proposes a framework for energy anomaly detection of IoT nodes using data transmission analysis. We use a public dataset that contains peer-to-peer IoT communication energy and link quality data. Our framework first utilizes linear regression to analyze and identify the dominant features of data communication for IoT transceivers. Later, a deep neural network modifies the gradient flow to focus on the dominant features. This modification improves the detection accuracy of anomalies by minimizing the associated reconstruction error. Finally, the energy stabilization feedback provides nodes with insight to change their transmission configuration for future communication. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms other unsupervised models in anomalous energy detection. It also proves that redesigning the conventional loss function by enhancing the impact of our dominant features can dramatically improve the reliability of the anomaly detection method.  © 2017 IEEE.","anomaly detection; deep learning; edge networks; energy consumption; IoT; link quality; low power; power consumption; smart city; Transmission protocol; unsupervised learning; wireless sensor networks","Anomaly detection; Computing power; Convolutional codes; Data communication systems; Deep neural networks; Electric power distribution; Green computing; Internet of things; Low power electronics; Peer to peer networks; Radio transceivers; Sensor nodes; Smart city; Unsupervised learning; Anomaly detection; Data-communication; Deep learning; EDGE Networks; Energy-consumption; IoT; Link quality; Low Power; Optimisations; Peer-to-peer computing; Transmission protocols; Energy utilization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178040343"

In response to this need, several computing paradigms, such as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Ultra-dense Edge Computing (UDEC), and Fog Computing (FC), have emerged. These paradigms aim to bring computing resources closer to the end user, reducing delay and wasted backhaul bandwidth. One of the major challenges of these new paradigms is the limitation of edge resources and the dependencies between different service parts. Some solutions, such as microservice architecture, allow different parts of an application to be processed simultaneously. However, due to the ever-increasing number of devices and incoming tasks, the problem of service placement cannot be solved today by relying on rule-based deterministic solutions. In such a dynamic and complex environment, many factors can influence the solution. Optimization and Machine Learning (ML) are two well-known tools that have been used most for service placement. Both methods typically use a cost function. Optimization is usually a way to define the difference between the predicted and actual value, while ML aims to minimize the cost function. In simpler terms, ML aims to minimize the gap between prediction and reality based on historical data. Instead of relying on explicit rules, ML uses prediction based on historical data. Due to the NP-hard nature of the service placement problem, classical optimization methods are not sufficient. Instead, metaheuristic and heuristic methods are widely used. In addition, the ever-changing big data in IoE environments requires the use of specific ML methods. In this systematic review, we present a taxonomy of ML methods for the service placement problem. Our findings show that 96% of applications use a distributed microservice architecture. Also, 51% of the studies are based on on-demand resource estimation methods and 81% are multi-objective. This article also outlines open questions and future research trends.

This paper identifies potential threats to the current MQTT-SN gateway and provides security while remaining concurrent. We propose a secure gateway application, SecGW, that achieves concurrency while remaining as robust to vulnerabilities as a single BIOS. The performance of SecGW is evaluated by measuring system scalability, resilience, processing delay, and consumed power through the analysis of payload transactions and their types. The evaluation has been carried out on a low-powered IoT testbed. The results of the experimental setup show satisfactorily linear scalability of memory, fairly consistent delays, and an insignificant increase in security-attributable power consumption for an increasing number of connected clients.

Quality Model for Object Oriented Design (QMOOD) is a verified model used for quality assessment of object-oriented software. The model associates quality metrics gathered from the source code and quality attributes in use to present a quality measurement. However, the model should be revised for recent multi-client software including native client applications, because there is a deficiency of metric gathering tools in such environments. More specifically, it is sometimes not possible to gather all quality properties required by QMOOD in all native development platforms of client applications. Hence, even though different client applications have the same design, the implementation quality cannot be monitored for the quality assurance. Analyzing and simplifying the metric set may alleviate this challenge, and a convenient quality assessment might be achieved. Thus, we propose to change the operational aspect of QMOOD by inserting an additional layer, Data Analytic, to the hierarchical structure of the conventional model. Accordingly, we provide a discussion on a case study including five native client applications.

It is currently used in a wide range of industries, from industrial automation and augmented reality, to smart cities and connected vehicles, where low latency, data privacy, and real-time processing are critical requirements. The latency of accessing applications in edge computing must be consistently below a threshold of a few tens of milliseconds to maintain an acceptable experience for end-users. However, the latency between users and applications can vary considerably depending on the network load and mode of wireless access. An application provider must be able to guarantee that requests are served in a timely manner by their application instances hosted in the edge despite such latency variations. This article focuses on the placement and traffic allocation problem faced by application providers in determining where to place application instances on edge nodes such that requests are served within a certain deadline. It proposes novel formulations based on robust optimization to provide optimal plans that protect against latency variations in a configurable number of network links. The robust formulations are based on two different types of polyhedral uncertainty sets that offer different levels of protection against variations in latency. Extensive simulations show that our robust models are able to keep the number of chosen edge nodes low while reducing the number of latency violations as compared to a deterministic optimization model that only considers the average latency of network links. © 2024 The Authors","Application placement; Edge computing; Robust optimization; Telecommunication networks; Uncertainty in network latency","Data privacy; Digital storage; Edge computing; Optimization; Application placements; Application providers; Edge computing; End-users; In networks; Network latencies; Robust optimization; Telecommunications networks; Uncertainty; Uncertainty in network latency; article; augmented reality; automation; controlled study; data privacy; human; latent period; simulation; telecommunication; uncertainty; Augmented reality","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186537354"

However, the performance of virtualized nodes sharing cache resources in 6G network slicing is degraded by the inappropriate allocation of resources. This paper proposes a cache resource allocation strategy for 6G network slicing based on game dynamics (RASGD). A 6G slicing network model is developed that describes the relationship between virtualized node mapping and resource sharing, and an evolutionary public goods game cache resource allocation (PGGRA) method is proposed to improve data transmission performance. This strategy defines the cache resource gap and selects the input cost according to the cache resource gap and evolutionary game strategy. When the cache resources are sufficient, the input is carried out, and when the cache resources are insufficient or the demand is large, unnecessary input is reduced to avoid the waste of resources, so as to achieve the intelligent allocation of cache resource. Simulation results demonstrate that the RASGD strategy improves the successful arrival rate of slice packets by at least 4.79% and improves the network congestion by at least 22.9% compared with the resource allocation strategy based on number of nodes (RANN) and resource allocation strategy based on node degree (RAND).  © 2024 IEEE.","Data transmission performance; evolutionary game; network slicing; resource allocation","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209751844"

However, the energy sector has yet to fully leverage these advancements. The primary associated challenge is the acquisition and processing of energy data which can be subject to stringent regulations imposed by data protection laws. This can hinder access to energy data for IoT service providers focusing on energy optimizations and analytics, thus hampering the development of energy IoT services. This challenge is particularly pertinent to manufacturing scenarios where energy-efficient processes are crucial for sustainable development.

This ranges from the introduction of new frequency bands and signaling technologies for the radio access network (RAN), to a core network underpinned by micro-services and network function virtualization (NFV). However, like any emerging technology, the pace of real-world deployments does not instantly match the pace of innovation. To address this discrepancy, one of the key aspects under continuous development is the RAN with the aim of making it more open, adaptive, functional, and easy to manage. In this paper, we highlight the transformative potential of embracing novel cellular architectures by transitioning from conventional systems to the progressive principles of Open RAN. This promises to make 6G networks more agile, cost-effective, energy-efficient, and resilient. It opens up a plethora of novel use cases, ranging from ubiquitous support for autonomous devices to cost-effective expansions in regions previously underserved. The principles of Open RAN encompass: (i) a disaggregated architecture with modular and standardized interfaces; (ii) cloudification, programmability and orchestration; and (iii) AI-enabled data-centric closed-loop control and automation. We first discuss the transformative role Open RAN principles have played in the 5G era. Then, we adopt a system-level approach and describe how these Open RAN principles will support 6G RAN and architecture innovation. We qualitatively discuss potential performance gains that Open RAN principles yield for specific 6G use cases.

However, it presents challenges for latency-sensitive scenarios due to data transmission to the centralized cloud structure, which leads to increased network traffic and service delays. To address this, fog computing has emerged as an intermediary layer between the cloud and IoT, ensuring low-latency interactions. A pivotal challenge within the fog computing paradigm is the service placement problem, involving assigning services to appropriate nodes, which is recognized as NP-hard. Recognizing the intricate nature of service placement, this study introduces a multi-objective optimization approach tailored for dynamic service placement within container-based fog computing environments. Considering multiple objectives is imperative due to the complex interplay of performance metrics in fog computing scenarios. A two-tier resource management framework based on Kubernetes is proposed to manage these diverse yet interrelated objectives effectively. The framework harnesses the power of the multi-objective, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) to reconcile conflicting objectives and facilitate optimal service placement decisions.

However, effective scheduling approaches are essential to meet application demands while maximizing cloud computing's potential. In this study, we propose an innovative workflow scheduling method for addressing the cost-effective, deadline-constrained scheduling challenge of IoT applications in cloud computing systems. Our solution, the F-ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, leverages a hybrid intelligence approach that combines ACO with a cost-driven heuristic strategy. The primary goal is to minimize workflow scheduling costs while ensuring that workflow deadlines are met. F-ACO introduces a deadline distribution method to derive task subdeadlines, enabling dynamic adjustments for unscheduled tasks to meet workflow deadlines. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive ACO-based task ordering mechanism with self-adaptive heuristic information to optimize task scheduling sequences, reducing search space redundancy and enhancing convergence speed. The approach includes a cost-driven task scheduling method designed to allocate each task to a acrlong VM with minimal execution cost and idle time, further optimizing the overall workflow scheduling cost. To validate our F-ACO algorithm, we conducted numerous simulations using real-world workflows and compared its performance against state-of-the-art algorithms.

Consequently, this popular software paradigm is increasingly used for the performance evaluation of server systems. Due to the scale and complexity of datacenters, the evaluation of server optimization techniques is usually done on a smaller scale using a client-server model. Although the experimental details of the server side are excessively described in most publications, the client side is often ignored. This paper identifies the hardware configuration of the client side as an important source of performance variation that can affect the accuracy and the correctness of the conclusions of a study that analyzes the performance of microservices. This is partially attributed to the strict latency requirements of microservices and the small scale of the experimental environment.In this work we present, using a widely used online-service, several examples where the accuracy and the trends of the conclusions differ based on the configuration of the client-side. At the same time we show that the experimental evaluation time can be significantly affected by the hardware configuration of the client. All these provoke the discussion of the right way to configure the experimental environment for assessing the performance of microservices.  © 2024 IEEE.","client-side; hardware configuration; microservices; performance variability","Client sides; Datacenter; Experimental environment; Hardware configurations; Microservice; On-line service; Performance; Performance variability; Running-in; Small scale; Software architecture","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214579098"

Although there are a multitude of existing methodologies for fault warning, the proficiency of these systems in processing and analysing data is increasingly challenged by the progression of industrial apparatus and the escalating magnitude and intricacy of the data involved. To address these challenges, this research outlines an innovative fault warning methodology that combines a bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network with an enhanced hunter–prey optimisation (EHPO) algorithm. The Bi-LSTM network is strategically utilised to outline complex temporal patterns in machinery operational data, while the EHPO algorithm is employed to meticulously fine-tune the hyperparameters of the Bi-LSTM, aiming to enhance the accuracy and generalisability of fault warning. The EHPO algorithm, building upon the foundational hunter–prey optimisation (HPO) framework, introduces an advanced population initialisation process, integrates a range of strategic exploration methodologies, and strengthens its search paradigms through the incorporation of the differential evolution (DE) algorithm. This comprehensive enhancement aims to boost the global search efficiency and accelerate the convergence speed of the algorithm. Empirical analyses, conducted using datasets from real-world industrial scenarios, have validated the improved warning performance of this proposed methodology against some benchmark techniques, as evidenced by superior metrics such as root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), albeit with a slight increase in computational resource requirements. This study not only proposes a novel paradigm for fault warning within complex industrial frameworks but also contributes to the discourse on hyperparameter optimisation within the field of machine learning algorithms. © 2024 by the authors.","deep learning architecture; enhanced optimisation approach; hyperparameter adjustment; industrial anomaly warning; synergising algorithms","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192704905"

When serving millions of users at once, cloud computing must provide all user requests with excellent performance and ensure Quality of Service (QoS). A suitable task scheduling algorithm is needed to appropriately and effectively fulfil these requests. Several methods were proposed for job scheduling in cloud computing, but the existing techniques do not provide better efficiency. The Dual Interactive Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network Optimized with Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm Based Job Scheduling in Cloud-Based Internet of Things is proposed to overcome this issue. Primarily, the data from the Alibaba dataset is preprocessed using the Kernel Co-Relation (KC) method. The preprocessed data is given to the Dual Interactive Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (DIWGAN) for task forecasting in the dynamic cloud environment, and it generates scheduled tasks as output. Then the Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA) is utilized to optimize the weight parameters of the Dual Interactive Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network. The proposed method precisely predicts the future workload and diminishes extravagant power consumption at cloud data centres. The proposed method is implemented in MATLAB.

This network can consist of personal computers, servers, IoT devices, and mobile devices. Botnets are one of the most common network security threats, used for malicious activities such as data theft, spamming, collecting personal information from users, and launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The growing popularity of IoT and mobile devices has made them an attractive target for attackers, as they often have unpatched security vulnerabilities. In today's world, computer networks play a crucial role in the information and communication technology era, connecting heterogeneous devices for data communication and sharing. However, the large number of Internet-connected devices makes them vulnerable to massive security attacks. Most widely-used IoT devices lack security design, making them vulnerable to recent attacks that exploit these weaknesses and recruit the devices to cause severe harm. Parallel multi-class classification refers to the process of performing classification tasks simultaneously on multiple classes or categories of data using parallel computing techniques. In traditional multi-class classification, a model is trained to classify data into one of several mutually exclusive classes. However, in some scenarios, it may be advantageous to perform these classifications in parallel, especially when dealing with a large number of classes or when speed and efficiency are crucial. Parallel multi-class classification can be implemented using parallel processing or distributed computing frameworks to train and evaluate multiple classifiers concurrently. © 2024, Ismail Saritas.

One approach widely employed to enhance the execution of parallel applications is thread-level parallelism (TLP) exploitation. This technique leverages multiple threads to improve computational efficiency and performance. However, the increasing heterogeneity of resources in cloud environments and the complexity of selecting the optimal configuration for each application pose a significant challenge to cloud users due to the massive number of possible configurations and the need to effectively harness TLP in diverse hardware setups to achieve optimal energy efficiency and performance.

In experiments using ten well-known applications on a private cloud with heterogeneous resources, we show that TLP-Allocator predicts combinations that yield EDP values close to the best achieved by an exhaustive search.

The challenges are to increase the productivity of cultivated areas, both for current and future areas, to manage the use of potable water, scarce in many regions, to keep the soil fertile, and to reduce waste through reuse, optimization, resource sharing, and operational and strategic management based on accurate information of planting, harvesting, and management of environmental conditions, which are also objectives of the Circular Economy. Therefore, using Industry 4.0 technologies in agriculture becomes fundamental to facing such challenges. This paper presents a systematic literature review on Industry 4.0 technologies adopted in agriculture for sustainable development, considering environmental, economic, and social benefits. The research pointed to the use of IoT in irrigation control systems by sending automatic commands, monitoring soil and weather conditions, in the use of machinery with some automation features and in cloud data storage systems, and with the use of Big Data analytical tools, with access by mobile devices, these uses contribute to operational and strategic decision making in the management of planting and harvesting. However, the literature review did not find a technological architecture for Integrated Services in Agriculture 4.0. Thus, this paper proposes a Service Architecture that enables the promotion of a Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0.

It provides a centralized system for IoT devices to interact with each other and with the cloud, facilitating the collection, processing, and analysis of data from these devices. However, in the automotive manufacturing industry, traditional Internet of Things (IoT) platforms are facing challenges such as bottleneck issues due to business volume growth and system challenges. To address these challenges, we propose a design methodology for an IoT platform based on microservices.

Hence, to support the continuous demand for the scheduling of real-time latency-sensitive tasks; the adaptability of fog computing is necessary which provide close adjacency to the tasks generating sources. Fog computing ensures optimal scheduling of latency-sensitive tasks by appropriate resource allocation considering dynamic user requirements. But the process of scheduling is an open challenge due to limited availability and processing capacity of fog resources. Further, provisioning of an appropriate fog resource is also necessary for timely execution of tasks. Hence, the papers present a novel task-scheduling heuristic algorithm; Matrix-based Task-Fog Pairing (MTFP) that aim to provide a feasible solution for fog resource provisioning to latency sensitive tasks. The algorithm worked on two different matrixes called compatibility and execution time matrix for scheduling priority tasks in order to achieve the desired Quality of Experience (QoE) to the end-user. Finally, the proposed algorithm MTFP is compared with the present state-of-the-art and shown improvement in term of reducing tasks execution time by 18%, delay by 16% and energy consumption by 14.5%. © Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management 2024.","Cloud computing; Fog computing; IoT; Resource scheduling; Task scheduling","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190545407"

Although serverless computing was initially considered for cloud environments, it has recently been extended to other layers of the computing continuum, i.e., edge and fog. This extension emphasizes that the proximity of computational resources to data sources can further reduce costs and improve performance and energy efficiency. However, orchestrating the computing continuum in complex application workflows, including a set of serverless functions, introduces new challenges.

Our focus is to reduce overall latency and improve data collection efficiency for delay-sensitive tasks through jointly optimizing the sensing data size, bandwidth allocation, and UAV hovering position. The formulated problem is a mixed-integer programming problem, which is also non-convex. We introduce an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to address this challenge. Specifically, the original minimization problem is decomposed into two subproblems. The first subproblem focuses on bandwidth and sensing data allocation. By leveraging the latent structure property of the problem, we derive the optimal sensing data allocation given a bandwidth allocation policy. Based on it, we reveal that the first optimization subproblem can be converted into a maximum weighted matching problem in a bipartite graph, which can be optimally solved using the Hungarian algorithm. To address the optimization of the UAV's hovering position subproblem, we employ the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique, which transforms it into a convex problem that can be efficiently solved by standard convex optimization solvers. We also analyze the convergence and the time complexity for the developed joint optimization algorithm. Afterward, we approximate the global optimal solutions in closed form for several specific cases of the problem.

This research spans a wide range of applications, including those from high-performance computing, machine learning, and mobile computing. Existing research frameworks often simplify research by concentrating on specific characteristics, such as the architecture of the computing nodes, resource monitoring, and representative workloads. For instance, this is typically the case with cloud systems, which introduce additional complexity regarding hardware and software requirements. To avoid this complexity during research, experimental frameworks are being developed. Nevertheless, proposed frameworks often fail regarding the types of nodes included, virtualization support, and management of critical shared resources. This paper presents Stratus, an experimental framework that overcomes these limitations. Stratus includes different types of nodes, a comprehensive virtualization stack, and the ability to partition the major shared resources of the system. Even though Stratus was originally conceived to perform cloud research, its modular design allows Stratus to be extended, broadening its research use on different computing domains and platforms, matching the complexity of modern cloud environments, as shown in the case studies presented in this paper. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.","Cloud computing; Experimental framework; High-performance computing; Resource management; Virtualization","Clouds; Energy efficiency; Green computing; Natural resources management; Resource allocation; Virtual reality; Cloud-computing; Experimental framework; Hardware testbeds; High-performance computing; Management research; Modular approach; Performance computing; Resource management; Shared resources; Virtualizations; Virtualization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180673547"

The current infrastructure of hardware technologies besides the available software stack is becoming obsolete for handling the advanced requirements of the smart energy ecosystem. Accordingly, software definitions of the Internet of Things (IoT) stack functions are gaining interest to provide more flexible and scalable implementations. This paper investigates a sophisticated softwarization explicit hybrid model predictive control strategy for energy storage facility systems through the accessor design pattern. This strategy is presumed to support and facilitate the integration of higher-level analytic and control functionalities within the IoT stack at edges and nodes.

Traffic congestion, pollutant emissions, energy consumption are some of the problems related to urban mobility. Therefore, there is the need of tools able to support decision-makers in studying, evaluating, and planning sustainable urban evolutions. A few open-source and proprietary solutions are available requiring on-premises installations, large effort, and providing limited capabilities to actually handle real-time data (from data spaces, and standards). Moreover, they are limited in terms of analytic integration and do not offer automatic generation of suggestions. In practice they do not manage the explosion of complexity regarding computational and storage/models aspects. For these reasons, this paper presents a comprehensive architecture for a Smart City Digital Twin platform, specifically designed to support mobility and transportation decision-making through advanced what-if analysis and optimization. The platform, integrated within the Snap4City system, enables real-time data processing and complex analytics to create virtual urban environments for evaluating potential infrastructure changes. Through microservice architecture, the platform supports massive data ingestion, scenario creation, and predictive modelling, facilitating both short-term and long-term planning. The solution leverages artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize city operations and suggest actionable insights, aiding city planners in strategic and tactical decisions. This architecture has been validated through implementations in Italian cities, demonstrating scalability and flexibility to accommodate diverse urban needs and improve traffic flow, energy efficiency, and environmental impact.

Hybrid deep learning partitions a DNN into two parts and deploys them across the mobile device and a server, aiming to reduce inference latency or prolong battery life of mobile devices. However, such partitioning produces (non-uniform) DNN fragments which are hard to serve efficiently on the server. This article presents Graft - an efficient inference serving system for hybrid deep learning with latency service-level objective (SLO) guarantees. Our main insight is to mitigate the non-uniformity by a core concept called DNN re-alignment, allowing multiple heterogeneous DNN fragments to be restructured to share layers. To fully exploit the potential of DNN re-alignment, Graft employs fine-grained GPU resource sharing. Based on that, we propose efficient algorithms for merging, grouping, and re-aligning DNN fragments to maximize request batching opportunities, minimizing resource consumption while guaranteeing the inference latency SLO. We implement a Graft prototype and perform extensive experiments with five types of widely used DNNs and real-world network traces. Our results show that Graft improves resource efficiency by up to 70% compared with the state-of-the-art inference serving systems.  © 1990-2012 IEEE.","Deep learning systems; edge computing; GPU sharing; hybrid deep learning","Alignment; Computer graphics; Constrained optimization; Deep neural networks; Edge computing; Grafting (chemical); Inference engines; Program processors; Deep learning; Deep learning system; Edge computing; GPU sharing; Hybrid deep learning; Mobile handsets; Network fragments; Optimisations; Resource management; Service level objective; Graphics processing unit","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179792572"

This proposal seeks to enable end users to effectively monitor and control their electrical devices while effectively integrating them into a wide network of power systems. The proposed architecture relies on a series of cloud services that enable better performance and control in energy efficiency management, highlighting key features of microservices such as fault tolerance, performance, and scalability. Using a structural methodology centered on preexisting components and an iterative approach, a versatile and scalable architecture was designed that addresses current challenges in energy efficiency management.

In the context of SVORA, the Delay-Aware Energy Efficiency-based RAN selection algorithm (DEER) is proposed. DEER employs utility functions and considers Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as throughput, resource block utilization, delay, and energy consumption measurements when finding the RAN to best support the requested service. DEER is highly flexible, being able to be tuned to support critical delay services, prioritizes energy saving, or observe a balanced approach. Testing shows that the SVORA-based DEER was able to increase the number of users and the aggregate data rate by about 10%, whereas the delay and energy consumption decreased by approximately 90% and 50%, respectively. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","","Delay tolerant networks; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; 'current; Delay aware; Energy; Heterogeneous network environments; Hetnets; Radio access networks; Radio access technologies; Selection algorithm; Service performance; Services-based architecture; Radio access networks","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212547685"

Serverless computing shows potential for meeting this requirement by scaling idle containers to zero energy-efficiency and cost, but this will lead to a cold start delay. Most solutions rely on idle containers, which necessitates dynamic request time forecasting and container execution monitoring. Furthermore, Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) can provide autonomous and sustainable solutions by combining IIoT with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve this problem. Therefore, we develop a new testbed, CAPTAIN, to facilitate AI-based co-simulation of scalable and flexible serverless computing in IIoT environments. The AI module in the CAPTAIN framework employs Random Forest (RF) and Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models to optimize cold start frequency and prevent cold starts based on their prediction results. The proxy module additionally monitors the client-server network and constantly updates the AI module training dataset via a message queue. Finally, we evaluated the proxy module's performance using a predictive maintenance-based real-world IIoT application and the AI module's performance in a realistic serverless environment using a Microsoft Azure dataset.

The increase in users within smart homes directly increases demand for IoT devices, leading to global energy consumption, latency and network usage issues in a Cloud network infrastructure. This study demonstrates the impact of increased users in smart homes through user scalability impact on energy consumption, latency and network bandwidth usage. Positioning data obtained from Phyphox is used as dummy data for this research. The ifogSim2 network simulation toolkit conducts user scalability simulations in a Cloud and Fog-based scenario. The results from the evaluation simulation of user scalability in a Cloud and Fog-based scenario demonstrate an average percentage difference of 3.10%, 90.33% and 33.03% for energy consumption, latency and network usage, respectively. The results indicate that the benefits of Fog computing address the challenges of Cloud computing through optimisation and provide a solution to the global issue of the increased number of IoT devices and users. The percentage difference for energy consumption was the lowest, followed by network usage, and latency was the highest. This variance shows that using and adopting Fog computing in a smart home network architecture is more efficient than traditional Cloud computing. The user scalability further demonstrates that as the number of users increases, the level of energy consumption, latency and network usage increase. Therefore, as the user demand for smart IoT devices increases, adopting Fog computing addresses the challenges associated with Cloud computing and optimises the energy consumption, latency and network usage in a smart home environment. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Cloud computing; Fog computing; Smart home; Smart IoT","Cloud platforms; Fog computing; Cloud networks; Cloud-computing; Energy; Energy networks; Energy-consumption; Global energy; Network usage; Smart homes; Smart IoT; Users' mobility; Smart homes","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209540234"

Nonetheless, challenges in communication costs, resource allocation, privacy, and security continue to constrain its proficiency in supporting services with diverse requirements. In response to these issues, this paper introduces socialized learning (SL) as a promising solution, further propelling the advancement of EI. SL is a learning paradigm predicated on social principles and behaviors, aimed at amplifying the collaborative capacity and collective intelligence of agents within the EI system. SL not only enhances the system's adaptability but also optimizes communication, and networking processes, essential for distributed intelligence across diverse devices and platforms. Therefore, a combination of SL and EI may greatly facilitate the development of collaborative intelligence in the future network. This paper presents the findings of a literature review on the integration of EI and SL, summarizing the latest achievements in existing research on EI and SL. Subsequently, we delve comprehensively into the limitations of EI and how it could benefit from SL. Special emphasis is placed on the communication challenges and networking strategies and other aspects within these systems, underlining the role of optimized network solutions in improving system efficiency. Based on these discussions, we elaborate in detail on three integrated components: socialized architecture, socialized training, and socialized inference, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we identify some possible future applications of combining SL and EI, discuss open problems and suggest some future research, with the hope of arousing the research community's interest in this emerging and exciting interdisciplinary field.  © 1998-2012 IEEE.","artificial intelligence (AI); edge computing (EC); Edge intelligence (EI); socialized learning (SL)","Adversarial machine learning; Collaborative learning; Federated learning; Mobile edge computing; Artificial intelligence; Computing paradigm; Data edges; Edge computing; Edge intelligence; Networked systems; Paradigm shifts; Socialized learning; Resource allocation","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207387120"

Experimenting with higher traffic loads requires upscaling a trace to artificially increase the load. Unfortunately, most prior research has adopted ad-hoc approaches for upscaling, and there has not been a systematic study of how the upscaling approach impacts the results. One common approach is to count the arrivals in a predefined time-interval and multiply these counts by a factor, but this requires generating new requests/jobs according to some model (e.g., a Poisson process), which may not be realistic. Another common approach is to divide all the timestamps in the trace by an upscaling factor to squeeze the requests into a shorter time period. However, this can distort temporal patterns within the input trace. This paper evaluates the pros and cons of existing trace upscaling techniques and introduces a new approach, TraceUpscaler, that avoids the drawbacks of existing methods. The key idea behind TraceUpscaler is to decouple the arrival timestamps from the request parameters/data and upscale just the arrival timestamps in a way that preserves temporal patterns within the input trace. Our work applies to open-loop traffic where requests have arrival timestamps that aren't dependent on previous request completions. We evaluate TraceUpscaler under multiple experimental settings using both real-world and synthetic traces. Through our study, we identify the trace characteristics that affect the quality of upscaling in existing approaches and show how TraceUpscaler avoids these pitfalls. We also present a case study demonstrating how inaccurate trace upscaling can lead to incorrect conclusions about a system's ability to handle high load.  © 2024 ACM.","Analysis; Cloud Computing; Measurement; Testing and Verification of Systems; Workloads","Analyse; Cloud-computing; Evaluating systems; High load; Real-world; Temporal pattern; Testing and verification of system; Time-stamp; Upscaling; Workload","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191979384"

The increasing adoption of microservice architectures, while offering scalability and flexibility, poses new challenges in the effective management of systems' energy consumption.This study analyzes experimentally the effectiveness, with respect to energy consumption, of algorithms for Anomaly Detection (AD) and Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for (containerized) microservices systems. The study analyzes five AD and three RCA algorithms. Metrics to assess the effectiveness of AD algorithms are Precision, Recall, and F-Score. For RCA algorithms, the chose metric is Precision at level k. Two subjects of different complexity are used: Sock Shop and UNI-Cloud. Experiments use a cross-over paired comparison design, involving multiple randomized runs for robust measures.The experiments show that AD algorithms exhibit a relatively moderate performance. The mean adjusted Precision for Sock Shop is 61.5%, while it is 75% for the best-performing algorithms (BIRCH, KNN, and SVM) on UNI-Cloud. The Recall and F-Score for UNI-Cloud, for the same algorithms, are 75%, while for Sock Shop KNN yields the best outcome at roughly 45%. MicroRCA and RCD emerge as the top-performing algorithms for RCA.We found that the effectiveness of AD algorithms is strongly influenced by anomaly thresholds, emphasizing the importance of careful tuning such algorithms. RCA algorithms reveal promising results, particularly RCD and MicroRCA, which showed robust performance. However, challenges remain, as seen with the ϵ-diagnosis algorithm, suggesting the need for further refinement.For DevOps engineers, the findings highlight the need to carefully select and tune AD and RCA algorithms for energy, and to take into account system topology and monitoring configurations.  © 2024 IEEE.","Anomaly Detection; Energy consumption; Microservices; Root Cause Analysis","Artificial intelligence; Cloud computing; Analysis algorithms; Anomaly detection; Anomaly-detection algorithms; Cloud data; Cloud-computing; Computing center; Energy-consumption; F-score; Microservice; Root cause analysis; Anomaly detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210250876"

The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to a growing interest in IoT traffic modeling due to the unique characteristics of IoT traffic, such as sudden data bursts and application-dependent traffic characteristics. The focus of the literature has been on modeling the arrival distribution of IoT traffic. However, this approach fails to capture important characteristics of time-series traffic, such as IoT traffic behaviors and seasonality patterns. Such characteristics provide crucial insights for the effective management and optimization of IoT networks. By exploiting time-series characteristics, dynamic resource allocation mechanisms can be designed instead of resource provisioning for peak usage. Additionally, comprehending the traffic generation behavior of IoT sensors can provide insight into the energy consumption of the sensor layer, which has a multitude of uses. In this article, we present a novel IoT traffic modeling framework called the tiered Markov-modulated stochastic process (TMMSP). The TMMSP framework can produce application-specific IoT time-series traffic traces that mimic the behaviors, e.g., the temporal dynamics, of real IoT traffic. Our results illustrate the flexibility and capability of the TMMSP framework in modeling the traffic behaviors of three IoT applications, specifically, telehealth, asset monitoring, and building security applications. Finally, we illustrate how the TMMSP framework can be used to evaluate the performance of an autonomous edge slicing (AES) mechanism.  © 2014 IEEE.","Automation; edge computing; Internet of Things (IoT); Markov models; network slicing; semi-Markov models; traffic modeling","Behavioral research; Energy utilization; Green computing; Internet of things; Markov processes; Stochastic systems; Time series analysis; 3GPP; Application specific; Behavioral science; Edge computing; Markov modeling; Network slicing; Process framework; Semi Markov model; Time-series analysis; Traffic modeling; Edge computing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164386755"

However, code smells can hinder this goal as they are visible signs of underlying issues. Numerous techniques and tools have been proposed for detecting code smells in various contexts and programming languages. Despite this, research on Android-specific code smells and their impact on external quality attributes is still in its early stages. Objective: This study aims to provide a comprehensive summary of state-of-the-art techniques, tools, and approaches used for detecting and refactoring code smells in Android applications. Methodology: A systematic literature review was conducted between November 2007 and December 2023, adhering to standard guidelines. In total, 79 primary studies were identified, analyzed, and synthesized. Results: A total of 237 code smells were identified using 51 techniques and tools, based on seven distinct approaches. Efficiency was found to be the most affected external quality attribute. The code smell Durable Wakelock was the most studied. Challenges: Despite the extensive research, the software engineering community faces numerous challenges. These include a lack of in-depth investigation into Android-specific code smells, a limited number of studied quality attributes, insufficient involvement of industry experts in the research process, scarcity of Android-oriented metrics, and dependence on industry-exclusive datasets.

In light of quantitative discussions, it is presented that AII exerts negative influences on GSCPI and GEUI, highlighting that the development of artificial intelligence would facilitate global supply chain stability and energy sustainability; in turn, GSCPI and GEUI have positive and adverse influences on AII. Through comparing, the correlation between AII and GEUI is only reflected in the short term, whereas the interrelationship between AII and GSCPI could be observed in the short-, medium- and long-run situations. In addition, GSCPI exerts positive and negative influences on GEUI in the short, medium and long runs, whereas the positive effects of GEUI on GSCPI means the uncertainty in the energy market might destroy the supply chain across the globe.

The tenant task placement in geo-distributed clouds comes with three critical and coupled factors: regional diversity in electricity prices, access delay for tenants, and traffic demand among tasks. However, existing works disregard either the regional difference in electricity prices or the tenant requirements in geo-distributed clouds, resulting in increased operating costs or low user QoS. To bridge the gap, we design a cost optimization framework for tenant task placement in geo-distributed clouds, called TanGo. However, it is non-trivial to achieve an optimization framework while meeting all the tenant requirements. To this end, we first formulate the electricity cost minimization for task placement problem as a constrained mixed-integer non-linear programming problem. We then propose a near-optimal algorithm with a tight approximation ratio (1-1/e)$ using an effective submodular-based method. Results of in-depth simulations based on real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our algorithm as well as the overall 10%-30% reduction in electricity expenses compared to commonly-adopted alternatives.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.","cost effectiveness; Geo-distributed cloud; multi region; regionless; task placement","Approximation algorithms; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Geographical distribution; Integer programming; Job analysis; Nonlinear programming; Operating costs; Costs Optimization; Datacenter; Delay; Distributed clouds; Geo-distributed cloud; Multi region; Optimisations; Regionless; Task analysis; Task placement; Distributed cloud","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174824112"

Identifying this problem highlights the need for an error detection technique, which is vital to minimize energy waste while enhancing household appliance efficiency. This paper introduces an innovative method for advanced proactive anomaly detection in multi-pattern home appliances using variational autoencoders (VAE). Specifically, a CNN-LSTM based VAE integrating a novel dynamic threshold method is exploited for identifying abnormal consumption usage. The overall suggested framework is a complete integrated approach comprising a training and testing phase. Both phases are initiated from robust feature engineering to enhance the multipattern operation program classification. Additionally, a smoothing and decomposition process is applied to optimize the performance of the CNN-LSTM VAE. The efficacy of the method is evaluated on data from 26 different front-load washing machines, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying anomaly points across various washing programs. Furthermore, compared to the same approach with a static threshold, the proposed method showed improvements of up to 11. 4% on the F1 score. Finally, simulated use case scenarios indicate a reduction of nearly 30% of energy consumption, due to error prevention. As a result, the suggested approach is a robust and applicable tool for energy and demand side management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Anomaly detection; Demand side management; Dynamic threshold; Energy efficiency; Multi-pattern; Sustainability; Variational autoencoders","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189884824"

Based on static configurations, traditional security approaches have proven ineffective in the face of the dynamic nature of emerging threats, as they cannot adapt in real time to changes in the environment or new attack vectors. This work proposes an adaptive security framework for Internet of Things (IoT) systems capable of autonomously detecting, mitigating, and adapting to various threats, improving precision and response times, and optimizing energy consumption. The framework was implemented in a distributed Internet of Things environment, using adaptive architectures based on the Robot Operating System (ROS) and microservices orchestration with Kubernetes. The results showed a significant improvement in response time, with a reduction of 44%, reaching an average of 250 milliseconds, compared to 450 milliseconds for static approaches. Furthermore, a 92% precision in threat detection was achieved, reducing false positives to 4% and false negatives to 6%. Power consumption was controlled, reaching a maximum of 160 milliamp-hours after facing multiple threats, confirming the system's efficiency in resource-limited environments. These results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive framework is a robust and efficient solution for security in Internet of Things environments, overcoming the limitations of traditional approaches and ensuring adequate protection without compromising energy efficiency.  © 2013 IEEE.","Adaptive security framework; energy efficiency in Internet of Things; Internet of Things; threat detection","Adaptive security; Adaptive security framework; Distributed environments; Energy; Energy efficiency in internet of thing; Energy optimization; Security approach; Security frameworks; Security threats; Threat detection; Robot Operating System","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209198932"

In this paper, we aim to survey the edge caching techniques from a comprehensive and systematic perspective. We first present an overview of edge caching, summarizing the three key issues regarding edge caching, i.e., where, what, and how to cache, and then introducing several significant caching metrics. We then carry out a detailed and in-depth elaboration on these three issues, which correspond to caching locations, caching objects, and caching strategies, respectively. In particular, we innovate on the issue 'what to cache', interpreting it as the classification of the 'caching objects', which can be further classified into content cache, data cache, and service cache.

However, in the temporary hotspot scenario for intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) in UAV-aided MEC networks, deploying blockchain-based services and applications in vehicles is generally impossible due to its high computational resource and storage requirements. One possible solution is to offload part of all the computational tasks to MEC servers wherever possible. Unfortunately, due to the limited availability and high mobility of the vehicles, there is still lacking simple solutions that can support low-latency and higher reliability networking services for ICVs. In this article, we study the task offloading problem of minimizing the total system latency and the optimal task offloading scheme, subject to constraints on the hover position coordinates of the UAV, the fixed bonuses, flexible transaction fees, transaction rates, mining difficulty, costs and battery energy consumption of the UAV. The problem is confirmed to be a challenging linear integer planning problem, we formulate the problem as a constrained Markov decision process. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has excellently solved sequential decision-making problems in dynamic ICVs environment, therefore, we propose a novel distributed DRL-based P-D3QN approach by using Prioritized Experience Replay strategy and the dueling double deep Q-network (D3QN) algorithm to solve the optimal task offloading policy effectively. Finally, experiment results show that compared with the benchmark scheme, the P-D3QN algorithm can bring about 26.24% latency improvement and increase about 42.26% offloading utility.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Indeed, monitoring and analysis tools have already been used to collect data from productivity tools. Monitoring inevitably consumes resources and, depending on their extensiveness, may significantly slow down software systems, interfering with developers’ activity. There is thus a challenging trade-off between monitoring and validating applications in their operational environment and preventing the degradation of the user experience. The lack of studies about when developers perceive an overhead introduced in an application makes it extremely difficult to fine-tune techniques working in the field. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting an empirical study that quantifies how developers perceive overhead. The study consists of three replications of an experiment that involved 99 computer science students in total, followed by a small-scale experimental assessment of the key findings with 12 professional developers. Results show that non-negligible overhead can be introduced for a short period into applications without developers perceiving it and that the sequence in which complex operations are executed influences the perception of the system response time. This information can be exploited to design better monitoring techniques. © The Author(s) 2024.","Empirical software engineering; Monitoring; User studies","Data acquisition; Response time (computer systems); Software engineering; Analysis tools; Delayed systems; Development practices; Development tasks; Empirical Software Engineering; Monitoring and analysis; Monitoring tools; Productivity tools; System response time; User study; Economic and social effects","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186432239"

In this respect, micro-electrical mechanical system (MEMS) sensors are widely used in several applications, including structural health monitoring (SHM), in which accelerometric samples are acquired to perform modal analysis. Thanks to their significantly lower cost, ease of installation in the structure, and lower power consumption, they enable extensive, pervasive, and battery-less monitoring systems. This paper presents an innovative high-performance device for SHM applications, based on a low-noise triaxial MEMS accelerometer, providing a guideline and insightful results about the opportunities and capabilities of these devices. Sensor nodes have been designed, developed, and calibrated to meet structural vibration monitoring and modal identification requirements. These components include a protocol for reliable command dissemination through network and data collection, and improvements to software components for data pipelining, jitter control, and high-frequency sampling. Devices were tested in the lab using shaker excitation. Results demonstrate that MEMS-based accelerometers are a feasible solution to replace expensive piezo-based accelerometers. Deploying MEMS is promising to minimize sensor node energy consumption. Time and frequency domain analyses show that MEMS can correctly detect modal frequencies, which are useful parameters for damage detection. The acquired data from the test bed were used to examine the functioning of the network, data transmission, and data quality.

Edge resources are limited when compared to traditional Cloud data centres; hence the choice of proper resource management strategies in this context becomes paramount. Microservice and Function as a Service architectures support modular and agile patterns, compared to a monolithic design, through lightweight containerisation, continuous integration / deployment and scaling. The advantages brought about by these technologies may initially seem obvious, but we argue that their usage at the Edge deserves a more in-depth evaluation. By analysing both the software development and deployment lifecycle, along with performance and resource utilisation, this paper explores microservices and two alternative types of serverless functions to build edge real-time IoT analytics. In the experiments comparing these technologies, microservices generally exhibit slightly better end-to-end processing latency and resource utilisation than serverless functions. One of the serverless functions and the microservices excel at handling larger data streams with auto-scaling. Whilst serverless functions natively offer this feature, the choice of container orchestration framework may determine its availability for microservices. The other serverless function, while supporting a simpler lifecycle, is more suitable for low-invocation scenarios and faces challenges with parallel requests and inherent overhead, making it less suitable for real-time processing in demanding IoT settings. © 2024 The Author(s)","Edge analytics; Function as a service; IoT; Microservices; Real-time; Serverless computing","Data Analytics; Data handling; Information management; Internet of things; Life cycle; Software design; Edge analytic; Edge-based; Function as a service; IoT; Life-cycle performance; Microservice; Real- time; Resources utilizations; Scalings; Serverless computing; Containers","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185531334"

The User Plane Function (UPF) is responsible for efficient data traffic forwarding and is envisioned as a key and pioneering core network function that will be deployed on satellites. However, managing and providing services with satellite UPFs face dual challenges. Limited satellite resources constrain the user scale that a satellite UPF can service, resulting in an unguaranteed service delay. Moreover, the extremely rapid mobility of satellites renders it difficult for satellite UPFs to provide seamless services. To address the above challenges, this paper presents the first-of-its-kind service optimization scheme for satellite UPFs in terms of switch control, state migration, and traffic routing. To provide guaranteed service delay, we provide a theoretical analysis based on the M/G/1 queue model, demonstrating the service delay-resource consumption trade-off. A satellite UPF switch control scheme is integrated into the service optimization process, which can decrease satellite UPF service delay while saving satellite resources by adjusting the switch control parameters. To provide seamless services, we propose a satellite UPF-oriented state-aware service migration and traffic routing (UPF service optimization) algorithm. A policy network-based reinforcement learning approach is employed to dynamically perceive the satellite network's state as well as the satellite UPF switch state. Building upon the optimization of service delay through satellite UPF switch control, the processes of state-aware state migration and traffic routing are further employed to reduce delay, ensuring seamless service effectively. Experiments reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms other benchmark algorithms under different metrics. The service delay is reduced by an average of 23.2% compared with other algorithms.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Delay-resource Consumption Trade-off; Policy Network; Satellite UPF; Service Optimization","Air navigation; Benchmarking; Decision making; Information management; Linear programming; Nonlinear programming; Product development; Queueing theory; Resource allocation; Routing algorithms; Delay-resource consumption trade-off; Policy networks; Resources consumption; Satellite user plane function; Seamless services; Service delays; Service optimization; Switch control; Trade off; User planes; 5G mobile communication systems","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208697245"

As a result of its proximity to IoT devices, the fog environment offers minimal latency, but it also faces resource limitations, which is not present in cloud environment. So a basic problem of the fog-cloud environment is the execute tasks that are offloaded from IoT devices by effectively using the fog-cloud resources. Hence, this research introduces a novel task scheduling approach based on the improved meta-heuristic algorithm. An improved zebra algorithm (ImZP) is proposed for performing the priority aware task scheduling. The zebra algorithm is hybridized with the mutation operation of the differential evolution algorithm (DE) for enhancing the exploration criteria to accomplish the global best solution. Besides, the acquisition of non-dominant solutions while considering the multi-objective fitness function, pareto optimal front is considered. Here, the multi-objective function based on priority, cost and execution time are considered in scheduling the task optimally. The analysis of ImZP show superior performance over the existing algorithims in terms of the metrics like priority, availability, makespan, energy consumption, cost and success rate.

Given the large adoption of these systems, several works have been proposed to detect performance anomalies starting from analysing the execution traces. However, most of the proposed approaches rely on machine learning (ML) algorithms to detect anomalies. While ML methods may be effective in detecting anomalies, the training and deployment of these systems as been shown to be less efficient in terms of time, computational resources, and energy required. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on Context-free grammar for anomaly detection of microservice systems execution traces. We employ the SAX encoding to transform execution traces into strings. Then, we select strings encoding anomalies, and for each possible anomaly, we build a Context-free grammar using the Sequitur grammar induction algorithm. We test our approach on two real-world datasets and compare it with a Logistic Regression classifier. We show how our approach is more effective in terms of training time of ∼15 seconds with a minimum loss in effectiveness of ∼5% compared to the Logistic Regression baseline.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","anomaly detection; context-free grammar; execution traces; micro service system","Classification (of information); Context free grammars; Encoding (symbols); Logistic regression; Machine learning; Signal encoding; Anomaly detection; Architectural pattern; Context-free grammars; Encodings; Execution trace; Large-scale applications; Micro service system; Micro services; Performance anomaly; Service systems; Anomaly detection","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193972246"

It aims to usher in an era of ubiquitous intelligent services, where everything is interconnected and intelligent. This vision requires the seamless integration of three fundamental modules: Sensing for information acquisition, communication for information sharing, and computation for information processing and decision-making. These modules are intricately linked, especially in complex tasks such as edge learning and inference. However, the performance of these modules is interdependent, creating a resource competition for time, energy, and bandwidth. Existing techniques like integrated communication and computation (ICC), integrated sensing and computation (ISC), and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) have made partial strides in addressing this challenge, but they fall short of meeting the extreme performance requirements. To overcome these limitations, it is essential to develop new techniques that comprehensively integrate sensing, communication, and computation. This integrated approach, known as Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation (ISCC), offers a systematic perspective for enhancing task performance. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of historic and related techniques such as ICC, ISC, and ISAC, highlighting their strengths and limitations. It then discusses the benefits, functions, and challenges of ISCC. Subsequently, the state-of-the-art signal designs for ISCC, along with network resource management strategies specifically tailored for ISCC are explored. Furthermore, this paper discusses the exciting research opportunities that lie ahead for implementing ISCC in future advanced networks, and the unresolved issues requiring further investigation. ISCC is expected to unlock the full potential of intelligent connectivity, paving the way for groundbreaking applications and services. © 2024 IEEE.","integrated communication and computation; Integrated sensing and communication; integrated sensing and computation; integrated sensing-communication-computation; network resource management; signal design; task-oriented communicationss","Inference engines; Information management; Resource allocation; Integrated communication and computation; Integrated sensing; Integrated sensing and communication; Integrated sensing and computation; Integrated sensing-communication-computation; Network resource management; Signal design; Task-oriented; Task-oriented communicationss; Decision making","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208377646"

Various studies have been conducted exploring dynamic provisioning in data centers with the objective of reducing overall energy consumption. However, many of these studies assume a fixed energy cost per operating server where each server can only handle one job within a given time slot. In this paper, we address a new and practical problem that involves speed scaling of multiple servers within a data center. Specifically, we consider a scenario where each server can handle multiple jobs simultaneously, and the energy consumed is a piece-wise convex function that depends on processing speed. In addition, turning on a server incurs a substantial energy cost. To tackle this problem, we develop a new online primal-dual fitting framework. By leveraging this framework, we have found that the straightforward LIF algorithm, which allocates new workloads to servers based on their minimal idle times, attains a bounded competitive ratio in comparison to the optimal offline solution. Building upon this finding, we have designed a novel algorithm called BDST . BDST dynamically updates server provisioning based on a long-term evaluation of the trade-off between the cost of maintaining high-speed for current servers and the cost of powering on additional servers. One critical aspect of BDST is its remarkable constant competitive ratio of less than three, regardless of the shape of the energy function. © 2024 Owner/Author.","capacity provisioning; energy efficiency; online scheduling algorithms","Aspect ratio; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Green computing; Quality of service; Scheduling algorithms; Capacity provisioning; Competitive ratio; Data clouds; Datacenter; Dynamic data; Energy cost; Online scheduling algorithm; Primal-dual; Proportion of energy; Speed scaling; Energy efficiency","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197401257"

Due to the limited computational capabilities of the sensors, the IoT devices require powerful remote servers to execute their tasks, and this phenomenon is called task offloading. Researchers have developed efficient task offloading and scheduling mechanisms for IoT devices to reduce energy consumption and response time. However, most research has not considered fault-tolerance-based job allocation for IoT logistics trucks, task and data-aware scheduling, priority-based task offloading, or multiple-parameter-based fog node selection. To overcome the limitations, we proposed a Multi-Objective Task-Aware Offloading and Scheduling Framework for IoT Logistics (MT-OSF). The proposed model prioritizes the tasks into delay-sensitive and computation-intensive tasks using a priority-based offloader and forwards the two lists to the Task-Aware Scheduler (TAS) for further processing on fog and cloud nodes. The Task-Aware Scheduler (TAS) uses a multi-criterion decision-making process, i.e., the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), to calculate the fog nodes’ priority for task allocation and scheduling. The AHP decides the fog nodes’ priority based on node energy, bandwidth, RAM, and MIPS power. Similarly, the TAS also calculates the shortest distance between the IoT-enabled vehicle and the fog node to which the IoT tasks are assigned for execution. A task-aware scheduler schedules delay-sensitive tasks on nearby fog nodes while allocating computation-intensive tasks to cloud data centers using the FCFS algorithm. Fault-tolerant manager is used to check task failure; if any task fails, the proposed system re-executes the tasks, and if any fog node fails, the proposed system allocates the tasks to another fog node to reduce the task failure ratio. The proposed model is simulated in iFogSim2 and demonstrates a 7% reduction in response time, 16% reduction in energy consumption, and 22% reduction in task failure ratio in comparison to Ant Colony Optimization and Round Robin. © 2024 by the authors.","analytical hierarchy process (AHP); computation-intensive tasks; delay-sensitive tasks; energy consumption; fault-tolerant manager; IoT task offloading & scheduling; smart transportation of logistics; task-aware scheduler","Ant colony optimization; Computation offloading; Decision making; Delay-sensitive applications; Fault tolerance; Fog; Hierarchical systems; Internet of things; Response time (computer systems); Analytical Hierarchy Process; Computation-intensive task; Delay sensitive; Delay-sensitive task; Energy-consumption; Fault-tolerant; Fault-tolerant manager; IoT task offloading & scheduling; Smart transportation of logistic; Task offloading; Task-aware; Task-aware scheduler; Tasks scheduling; adult; algorithm; analytic hierarchy process; ant colony optimization; article; bandwidth; controlled study; decision making; diagnosis; energy consumption; female; human; internet of things; male; reaction time; sensor; simulation; traffic and transport; Energy utilization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191409032"

Our findings indicate that it is important to expand the FAIR principles to include thorough documentation, performance assessments, and robust testing frameworks for a more complete evaluation. As Internet of Things (IoT) applications and technologies become increasingly common, these tools must adapt to meet the unique challenges posed by complex and interconnected systems. Addressing these issues is vital for ensuring security and scalability within IoT environments. By implementing this FAIR-based approach, we aim to support the development of static code analysis tools that cater to the evolving needs of the software engineering community while ensuring they remain sustainable and reliable. © 2013 IEEE.","FAIR principles; IoT; python; software quality; static code analysis","Application programs; Computer software selection and evaluation; Reusability; Ease-of-use; FAIR principle; Long-term viability; Performance metrices; Software metrics; Software Quality; Software quality assurance; Static code analysis; Static code analysis tools; Technical capabilities; Python","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210011091"

Service providers rely on container multi-tenancy to share their computing infrastructure and pave their way to profit. Yet, the Quality of Service (QoS) impact due to container multi-tenancy on deployed services is still widely overlooked in the literature. This paper proposes a new service provider monitoring model for detecting container multi-tenancy that can lead to QoS degradation, split into two phases. First, we monitor the container resource usage through the container engine and the associated process namespace, thus, keeping container isolation. The main assumption is that the assessment of resource utilization, as measured by the container engine, should be complemented by the concurrent reporting of resource utilization from the container processes. Second, we detect QoS degradation of distributed containerized services through a time-series classification approach coped with a feature reduction technique. The feature reduction selects the prominent performance features from the deployed distributed service, whereas the time-series classifier ensures the evaluation of the deployed service over time, improving the system detection accuracy. Thanks to an extensive experimental assessment considering a containerized distributed Big Data processing platform, we show that container multi-tenancy can affect the processing performance and the QoS of deployed services. In addition, we show that the proposed model can detect QoS degradation at the service provider domain with a true-positive rate up to 90%, a false-positive rate of 8%, and an average F1-Score up to 0.94. © 2024","Container; Docker; Kubernetes; Machine learning; Multi-tenancy; QoS","Containers; Data handling; Engines; Feature extraction; Time series; Deployed services; Docker; Features reductions; Kubernetes; Machine-learning; Multi tenancies; Quality-of-service; Resources utilizations; Service degradation; Service provider; Quality of service","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184018867"

Jellyfish handles the network variability by utilizing both data and deep neural network (DNN) adaptation to conduct tradeoffs between accuracy and latency. Jellyfish features a new design that enables collective adaptation policies where the decisions for data and DNN adaptations are aligned and coordinated among multiple users with varying network conditions. We propose efficient algorithms to continuously map users and adapt DNNs at runtime, so that we fulfill latency SLOs while maximizing the overall inference accuracy. We further investigate dynamic DNNs, i.e., DNNs that encompass multiple architecture variants, and demonstrate their potential benefit through preliminary experiments.

Some learning-based methods use online task offloading without considering task dependency and network flow scheduling, leading to underutilized resources and flow congestion. We study Online Dependent Task Offloading (ODTO) in CEC, jointly optimizing network flow scheduling to optimize quality of service by reducing task completion time and energy consumption. The challenge of ODTO lies in how to offload dependent tasks and schedule network flows in dynamic networks. We model ODTO as the Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose an Asynchronous Deep Progressive Reinforcement Learning (ADPRL) approach that optimize offloading and bandwidth decisions.

Existing solutions are slow to adapt and neglecting the temporal patterns of service resource demand. This paper proposes a novel service placement algorithm based on double deep Q-Network and prioritized experience replay (DDQN-PER), which explores the optimal service placement strategy using the adaptive learning ability of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The DRL agent learns the dynamic nature of the resource requirements of services to find an appropriate fog node for service placement. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, experiments are carried out using Measurement and Analysis on the WIDE Internet (MAWI) traffic traces. The proposed DDQN-PER algorithm, compared with other state-of-the-art methods and experimental results, show that the proposed method can minimize the service latency time and fog node's energy consumption from 2.5% to 8% and 6% to 17%, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Deep reinforcement learning; Energy consumption; Fog computing; Latency; Prioritized experience replay; Service placement","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185165442"

These technologies, combined with Big Data for managing vast datasets, cloud computing for storage and accessibility, edge computing for localized data processing, and digital twins for simulating aquatic systems, offer powerful solutions. However, challenges such as sensor reliability, data management, and system integration persist and must be addressed.

Unlike existing studies, we formulate a total cost minimization problem for the system for applications, which can be divided into several interdependent subtasks. Each subtask can be executed in MDs, ENs, and the cloud. This work formulates a mixed-integer nonlinear program to minimize the total system cost. To address it, a novel meta-heuristic optimization algorithm called Genetic Simulated-annealing-based Particle swarm optimization with Auto-Encoder (GSPAE) is proposed, which innovatively combines feature extraction of deep learning and global search of meta-heuristic optimization. Genetic operations provide diverse solutions, the Metropolis acceptance of annealing offers a robust global search, and autoencoders extract distribution characteristics of particles towards high-quality regions for fast convergence. Thus, GSPAE optimizes the associations between ENs and MDs and the scheduling of subtasks among MDs, ENs, and the cloud. Experiments with large-scale Google cluster datasets show that compared to state-of-the-art benchmark methods, GSPAE reduces the total cost by at least 17% while strictly meeting limits of application latency, available energy, computing, and communication resources of ENs and MDs. © 2014 IEEE.","autoencoders; Cloud computing; deep learning; edge computing; particle swarm optimization; task offloading","Cloud platforms; Computation offloading; Deep learning; Integer programming; Nonlinear programming; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Simulated annealing; Auto encoders; Cloud-computing; Deep learning; Edge computing; Edge nodes; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Subtask; Swarm optimization; Task offloading; Mobile edge computing","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214703352"

Due to such issues, wireless communications require energy consumption, frequent data transmission, and nodes' mobility. Secondly, loss of data packets occurs because of various reasons such as traffic congestion, node mobility, or unexpected losses. An efficient vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) routing protocol is proposed in this study using a genetic algorithm (GA) and evolution-based techniques while considering all the parameters. A new fitness function (F.F) to obtain the optimum route is proposed in this study by using the routes provided by the Ad hoc on-demand multipath distance vector AOMDV routing protocol. This study uses a new type of routing mechanism based on cryptography to demonstrate how to secure V2V and V2I communications from various network threats in a VANET environment. For VANET communications, the transmission message must meet the requirements for integrity, confidentiality, and non-repudiation to ensure that a trustworthy third party can identify users with a pattern of misbehavior. While ensuring optimized route selection and secured communications, a hybrid approach AOMDV-RGA and ABC is proposed. AOMDV-RGA (AOMDV Routing using Genetic Algorithm) is used for selecting optimal routes among the routes, and ABSC (Authentication Based Secured Communication) is proposed for performing secured communication between V2V and V2I.

However, selecting an appropriate framework among the myriad available options, especially given the diversity of emerging execution environments, presents a significant challenge. Often, this decision neglects crucial factors such as performance and energy efficiency, favoring instead developer familiarity and popularity within the industry. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive benchmark study using a prototype REST API application provided by an industry partner, which was implemented multiple times using different REST API frameworks. We evaluated five different REST API frameworks across three popular programming languages, incorporating both traditional and emerging execution environments, resulting in twelve distinct configurations. Our results reveal significant differences in performance and computational resource consumption across different frameworks and execution environments, highlighting the necessity of making informed technology choices based on thorough analysis rather than convenience or familiarity. In addition to our findings, we offer other contributions to the field: an automated pipeline that benchmarks different configurations with various frameworks and execution environments, and a reference benchmark REST API that can be used in other studies.

Provisioning resources to serverless services, however, poses several challenges, due to the high cold-start latency of containers and stringent Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements of the microservices. In response, we investigate the behavior of containers in different states (i.e., running, warm, or cold) and exploit our experimental observations to formulate an optimization problem that minimizes the energy consumption of the active servers while reducing SLA violations. In light of the problem complexity, we propose a low-complexity algorithm, named AiW, which utilizes a multi-queueing approach to balance energy consumption and system performance by reusing containers effectively and invoking cold-starts only when necessary. To further minimize the energy consumption of data centers, we introduce the two-timescale COmputing resource Management at the Edge (COME) framework, comprising an orchestrator running our proposed AiW algorithm for container provisioning and Dynamic Server Provisioner (DSP) for dynamically activating/deactivating servers in response to AiW's decisions on request scheduling. COME addresses the mismatch in timescales for resource provisioning decisions at the container and server levels. Extensive performance evaluation through simulation shows AiW's close match to the optimum and COME's significant reduction in power consumption by 22-64% compared state-of-the-art alternatives. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Cloud Computing Services; Edge Computing; Energy-aware Management; Orchestration","Edge computing; Energy utilization; Information management; Cloud computing services; Cold-start; Dynamic management; Edge computing; Energy aware; Energy-aware management; Energy-consumption; Orchestration; Servicelevel agreement (SLA); Time-scales; Cloud platforms","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209387259"

The components encompass many procedures, namely service design, service transition, service operation, and constant service improvement. The proliferation of information service management aligns with the ubiquity of the internet and its web-based services, notwithstanding the constraints posed by intermittent wireless connectivity. When the attainment of web service reliability is accomplished, there is a decrease in communication overhead, resulting in the retrieval of the correct response with little exertion. The worldwide pandemic issue presents an opportunity to glean useful insights that can contribute to the progress of digital health technologies. The remote monitoring of patient's health conditions and treatment actions inside the health system is crucial to mitigate the potential danger of disease transmission. Furthermore, there is a need for further development of digital technology that enables the sharing of information and facilitates evidence-based decision-making among stakeholders. The provision of data integration and analysis services is necessitated by the utilization of web services. The utilization of the middleware technique is deemed to be more suitable for web services.

The imperative of pre-hospital emergency response demands an urgent reevaluation of current resource allocation strategies in edge networks. Traditional static dispatch protocols often fall short in dynamically optimizing ambulance deployment, leading to life-threatening delays and suboptimal patient outcomes.

Traditionally, this sensor data is transferred and processed at the cloud, and the control signals are sent back to the relevant actuators, as part of the IoT applications. This cloud-centric IoT model, resulted in increased latencies and network load, and compromised privacy. To address these problems, Fog Computing was coined by Cisco in 2012, a decade ago, which utilizes proximal computational resources for processing the sensor data. Ever since its proposal, fog computing has attracted significant attention and the research fraternity focused at addressing different challenges such as fog frameworks, simulators, resource management, placement strategies, quality of service aspects, fog economics and so forth. However, after a decade of research, we still do not see large-scale deployments of public/private fog networks, which can be utilized in realizing interesting IoT applications. In the literature, we only see pilot case studies and small-scale testbeds, and utilization of simulators for demonstrating scale of the specified models addressing the respective technical challenges. There are several reasons for this, and most importantly, fog computing did not present a clear business case for the companies and participating individuals yet. This article summarizes the technical, non-functional, and economic challenges, which have been posing hurdles in adopting fog computing, by consolidating them across different clusters. The article also summarizes the relevant academic and industrial contributions in addressing these challenges and provides future research directions in realizing real-time fog computing applications, also considering the emerging trends such as federated learning and quantum computing. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","fog challenges; fog computing; fog economics; fog offloading; fog state-of-the-art; Internet of Things","Computation offloading; Data handling; Fog computing; Industrial research; Internet of things; Quality of service; Computational resources; Control signal; Fog challenge; Fog economic; Fog offloading; Fog state-of-the-art; Network load; Real-time application; Sensors data; State of the art; Fog","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165319251"

Smart public lighting systems are designed using LED light sources in combination with a controller based on light intensity and motion sensors to control the brightness in working areas as per standard requirements. The control of smart public lighting systems is designed to operate in three modes: manual, scheduled, and auto modes, which are tested and compared in terms of lighting and power quality. Other functions of IoT, such as air pollution detection, security system-based video surveillance, and warning systems for flood disasters, are integrated into smart public lighting systems. A prototype of the designed smart public lighting system is presented in this paper. The parameters of average illuminance, overall uniformity, and threshold increment were implemented using DIALux software to optimise the luminaire spacing. The results showed that the goal of energy saving could be achieved using the auto mode. Although the automatic mode caused current harmonic distortion to the electrical grid, the harmonic value was less than the specified standard.

Nevertheless, there is ongoing debate surrounding the unexplored possibilities of the IoT within the energy industry. The requirement to better the performance of distributed energy systems necessitates transitioning from traditional mission-critical electric smart grid systems to digital twin-based IoT frameworks. Energy storage systems (ESSs) used within nano-grids have the potential to enhance energy utilization, fortify resilience, and promote sustainable practices by effectively storing surplus energy. The present study introduces a conceptual framework consisting of two fundamental modules: (1) Power optimization of energy storage systems (ESSs) in peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. (2) Task orchestration in IoT-enabled environments using digital twin technology. The optimization of energy storage systems (ESSs) aims to effectively manage surplus ESS energy by employing particle swarm optimization (PSO) techniques. This approach is designed to fulfill the energy needs of the ESS itself as well as meet the specific requirements of participating nano-grids. The primary objective of the IoT task orchestration system, which is based on the concept of digital twins, is to enhance the process of peer-to-peer nano-grid energy trading. This is achieved by integrating virtual control mechanisms through orchestration technology combining task generation, device virtualization, task mapping, task scheduling, and task allocation and deployment. The nano-grid energy trading system’s architecture utilizes IoT sensors and Raspberry Pi-based edge technology to enable virtual operation. The evaluation of the proposed study is carried out through the examination of a simulated dataset derived from nano-grid dwellings. This research analyzes the efficacy of optimization approaches in mitigating energy trading costs and optimizing power utilization in energy storage systems (ESSs). The coordination of IoT devices is crucial in improving the system’s overall efficiency. © 2023 by the authors.","complex problem solving; critical IoT systems; Internet of Things; nano-grid; optimization; task modeling; task orchestration","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Internet of things; Navigation systems; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Peer to peer networks; Power markets; Smart power grids; Complex problem solving; Critical internet of thing system; Energy industry; Energy trading; Nano-grid; Optimisations; Storage systems; Surplus energy; Task modelling; Task orchestration; article; conceptual framework; diagnosis; digital twin; electric potential; energy; internet of things; particle swarm optimization; problem solving; raspberry; sensor; simulation; Energy storage","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180617758"

In the IaaS cloud, the virtual machine (VM) is the execution unit that processes the user workloads. Virtualization enables the execution of multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical machine (PM). Virtual machine placement (VMP) strategically assigns VMs to suitable physical devices within a data center. From the cloud provider's perspective, the virtual machine must be placed optimally to reduce resource wastage to aid economic revenue and develop green data centres. Cloud providers need an efficient methodology to minimize resource wastage, power consumption, and network transmission delay.

The performance metrics (Overall Nondominated Vector Generation and Spacing) of the proposed NSGA-III algorithm is compared with other multi-objective algorithms, namely VEGA, MOGA, SPEA, and NSGA-II.

This leads to an issues in various aspects like, increase in complexity, low data rate & latency and security may reduce the performance of the existing technologies. Therefore, there is a huge requirement of advanced technology which may support ultra-low latency transmission for the task received from the devices. Fog computing (FC) is one of an emerging technology that can improve network performance and provide resource-constrained applications for the IoT devices. In this paper, the Optimal Energy-efficient Resource Allocation (OEeRA) algorithm is proposed based on Minimal Cost Resource Allocation (MCRA) and Fault Identification and Rectification (FIR) algorithms for effective task offloading of IoT-FoG computing networks. The MCRA algorithm is proposed to assign at least one FN and Resource Block (RB) for each device, and also it ensures that each FN is connected with one or more RBs and devices. The leftover RBs are collected and stored in the buffer to replace the faulty RBs, as proposed in the FIR algorithm, which achieves better processing and response time with higher fault detection accuracy. The energy efficiency (EE) of the proposed OEeRA algorithm is computed through MCRA and FIR algorithms by varying FN, RB, and IoT devices. The performance analysis shows that the proposed algorithm achieved the maximum EE of 6.12 × 109 bit/J, 5.69 × 1010 bit/J, and 3.019 × 1010 (bit/J) for varying RBs, IoTs, and FNs, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Energy Efficiency; Fault Tolerance; Fog Computing; Internet of Things; Task offloading","Automation; Computational complexity; Energy efficiency; Fault detection; Fault tolerance; FIR filters; Fog; Internet of things; Resource allocation; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Vehicle transmissions; Energy-efficient resource allocation; Fault identifications; Identification algorithms; Minimal cost; Optimal energy; Rectification algorithms; Resource allocation algorithms; Resources allocation; Smart objects; Task offloading; Fog computing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177615927"

However, real-world applications are not only neural networks but often span across multiple domains, e.g., database queries, compression, encryption, video coding, signal processing, and traditional machine learning, which may or may not contain deep learning. The sole focus on this single domain is sub-optimal as it misses the potential to proliferate and promote cross-domain multi-acceleration as there is an opportunity to harness the power of chaining heterogeneous Domain-Specific Architectures (DSAs) in modern datacenter applications. However, there is a catch as the data motion overhead can outweigh the benefits from all these chained heterogeneous accelerators. We dub the data restructuring and communication overhead of executing a single application using a chain of accelerators [1] as the data motion overhead. In a stark contrast with most works on DSAs that deal with accelerating compute kernels, this work focuses on accelerating data motion within a chain of heterogeneous DSAs in a multi-accelerator datacenter. To that end, this paper introduces Data Motion Acceleration (DMX) for (1) reducing data movement, (2) accelerating data restructuring, and (3) enabling interoperability between heterogeneous accelerators from different domains through a cross-stack hardware-software solution. The results with five end-to-end applications show that utilizing DMX offers up to 8.2 ×, 13.6 ×, and 5.2 × improvement in latency, throughput, and energy efficiency in a multi-accelerator system, respectively.  © 2024 IEEE.","","Cryptography; Energy efficiency; Query languages; Video signal processing; Cross-domain; Data motion; Data restructuring; Database queries; Datacenter; Domain specific architectures; Heterogeneous domains; Multiple domains; Neural-networks; Real-world; Deep learning","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190262143"

Monitoring frameworks can serve these purposes by deploying probes according to many possible patterns that have different features, for instance in terms of efficiency and privacy. So far, these probe deployment patterns have not been systematically defined, analyzed and assessed. Thus, engineers who design and configure their monitoring systems have to take decisions only based on partial knowledge and personal experience. This article addresses this knowledge gap, by presenting a systematic analysis of 11 probe deployment patterns, their known uses, and implementations. We assess these patterns qualitatively, and quantitatively using both VMs and containers. Results show the targets have negligible resource consumption (e.g., less than 1% CPU usage), while the probe holder consumption is mainly significant in relation to memory consumption, reaching up to 10 GiB in our experiments. Our findings suggest that reusing probes and holders among users can generally enhance efficiency and scalability when direct access to the monitored target is not an option. We generate a set of best practices that can assist engineers in configuring their monitoring systems. Finally, we showcase the application of certain patterns through three practical usage scenarios, which feature diverse technologies and requirements.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.","cloud computing; cloud monitoring; container monitoring; deployment patterns; design patterns; monitoring best practices; Monitoring probes; probe deployment","Cloud computing; Efficiency; Probes; Quality of service; Time series analysis; Best practices; Cloud monitoring; Cloud-computing; Container monitoring; Deployment pattern; Design Patterns; Monitoring best practice; Monitoring probes; Probe deployment; Time-series analysis; Virtual machining; Containers","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182384243"

In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based dynamic cloud scheduling technique using intelligent agents, which intelligently adapt to users’ requirements and selective quality of services based on distributed learning in edge-cloud computing environments. The proposed cloud task scheduling method is composed of two logical components: distributed learning management (learning distribution and aggregation) and intelligence management of multi-agents, which are independent of each other.

In the event of a sudden increase in workload, microservices (MSs) can face challenges such as resource exhaustion and many discarded requests. CBs can help mitigate these issues by monitoring the services and, if necessary, redirecting the flow of requests to another infrastructure. However, it is difficult to evaluate the behavior of these infrastructures and CB mechanisms in a production environment. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a model using stochastic Petri nets (SPNs) to represent these infrastructures and their auto-scaling mechanisms, the MSs, the CBs, the incoming external arrival rate, and the workload generated between the MSs. Service providers can estimate metrics including circuit breaker activation (CBA), overload forwarding rate (OFR), containers utilization (Uc), unallocated containers (NUc), throughput (TP), discard probability (DP), and discard rate (DR). The model enables the performance evaluation of individual MSs and the entire microservice platform (MP). The work investigates how the microservices adapt to changing conditions and the trade-offs associated with different CB configurations. Using a real testbed, our solution was validated with a confidence interval (CI) of 95%. A case study was used to investigate the feasibility of the solution by evaluating its application in a real-world scenario. We found that the CBs reduced DR by 71.4% on average. This corresponds to an average number of 75,454 requests over 1 hour that were not discarded but forwarded to another infrastructure.  © 2024 IEEE.","Circuit Breakers; Microservices; Performance Modeling; Stochastic Petri Nets","Containers; Economic and social effects; Petri nets; Satellites; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Timing circuits; Arrival rates; Circuit-breakers; Microservice; Performance Modeling; Production environments; Protection mechanisms; Scaling mechanism; Service provider; Servicelevel agreement (SLA); Stochastic Petri Nets; Electric circuit breakers","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197342863"

We find that cloud compute servers cause the majority of emissions in a general-purpose cloud. Thus, we motivate designing carbon-efficient compute server SKUs, or GreenSKUs, using recently-available low-carbon server components. To this end, we design and build three GreenSKUs using low-carbon components, such as energy-efficient CPUs, reused old DRAM via CXL, and reused old SSDs.We detail several challenges that limit GreenSKUs, carbon savings at scale and may prevent their adoption by cloud providers. To address these challenges, we develop a novel methodology and associated framework, GSF (GreenSKU Framework), that enables a cloud provider to systematically evaluate a GreenSKU's carbon savings at scale. We implement GSF within Microsoft Azure's production constraints to evaluate our three GreenSKUs' carbon savings. Using GSF, we show that our most carbon-efficient GreenSKU reduces emissions per core by 28 % compared to currently-deployed cloud servers. When designing GreenSKUs to meet applications' performance requirements, we reduce emissions by 15 %.

In this work, we perform a thorough characterization of the serverless environment and observe that it poses a set of challenges not effectively handled by existing energy-management schemes. Short serverless functions execute in opaque virtualized sandboxes, are idle for a large fraction of their invocation time, context switch frequently, and are co-located in a highly dynamic manner with many other functions of diverse properties. These features are a radical shift from more traditional application environments and require a new approach to manage energy and power. Driven by these insights, we design EcoFaaS, the first energy management framework for serverless environments. EcoFaaS takes a user-provided end-to-end application Service Level Objective (SLO). It then splits the SLO into per-function deadlines that minimize the total energy consumption. Based on the computed deadlines, EcoFaaS sets the optimal per-invocation core frequency using a prediction algorithm. The algorithm performs a fine-grained analysis of the execution time of each invocation, while taking into account the specific invocation inputs. To maximize efficiency, EcoFaaS splits the cores in a server into multiple Core Pools, where all the cores in a pool run at the same frequency and are controlled by a single scheduler. EcoFaaS dynamically changes the sizes and frequencies of the pools based on the current system state. We implement EcoFaaS on two open-source serverless platforms (OpenWhisk and KNative) and evaluate it using diverse serverless applications. Compared to state-of-the-art energy-management systems, EcoFaaS reduces the total energy consumption of serverless clusters by 42 % while simultaneously reducing the tail latency by 34.8 %. © 2024 IEEE.","cloud computing; energy efficiency; serverless computing","Computing power; Energy management; Energy management systems; Energy utilization; Green computing; Lakes; Cloud-computing; Co-located; Context switch; Energy management schemes; Energy-consumption; Existing energies; Serverless computing; Service level objective; Time contexts; Total energy; Energy efficiency","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201158993"

High-resolution applications like synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging use LEO satellite systems, which face significant challenges in effectively regulating energy consumption and reducing work latency. To address these challenges, we proposed a novel approach that utilizes the lowest-cost method based on a genetic algorithm (LCMGA). This strategy focuses on allocating computing subtasks and optimizing energy consumption by parallel offloading them over multiple SEC nodes. The primary objective is to decrease energy costs while upholding task latency demands. The LCMGA algorithm utilizes the computing resource of edge satellites in the LISL range to determine the most efficient methods of offloading tasks. The simulation findings demonstrate that LCMGA significantly reduces the computational time for processing large volumes of data, achieving processing durations of only a few seconds. In addition, LCMGA surpasses existing algorithms in terms of energy usage and CPU energy efficiency. © 2024 IEEE.","energy optimization; genetic algorithm; laser-based inter-satellite links; LEO satellite networks; parallel task offloading","Communication satellites; Computation offloading; Data reduction; Energy utilization; Geodetic satellites; Gluing; Micro satellites; Network security; Satellite communication systems; Tropics; Energy optimization; Intersatellite links; Laser-based; Laser-based inter-satellite link; Low earth orbit satellite network; Low earth orbit satellites; Parallel task; Parallel task offloading; Satellite network; Task offloading; Satellite links","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206447937"

However, most existing methods for online anomaly detection have limitations in efficiency, effectiveness and timeliness, especially with the massive and distributed data streams from IIoT devices. Therefore, developing a data stream processing framework to discover anomalies in time and ensure the proper operation of the system is an urgent issue for IIoT. In this paper, we propose a flexible stream processing framework that enables online anomaly detection for IIoT applications. The framework exploits a distributed computing architecture based on docker containers to improve flexibility, migration capability and customization. The framework also uses a central mediator to coordinate data stream processing tasks running on different docker nodes. Moreover, we develop a prediction-based online anomaly detection model that consists of batch model training and data stream anomaly detection processes. The model uses long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict data stream values and a dynamic sliding window method to model prediction errors and detect anomalies. We implement a case study to detect abnormal heating temperatures from an industrial heating plant and evaluate the performance of the proposed framework and anomaly detection model.

However, achieving such benefits is very challenging due to the heterogeneous computing power of terminal devices and the complex environment faced by the CETCN. In particular, the high-dimensional and dynamic environment states cause difficulties for the CETCN to make efficient decisions in terms of task offloading, collaborative caching and mobility management. To this end, artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been proven effective in solving sequential decision-making problems in various domains, and offers a promising solution for the above-mentioned issues due to several reasons. Firstly, accurate modelling of the CETCN, which is difficult to obtain for real-world applications, is not required for the DRL-based method. Secondly, DRL can effectively respond to high-dimensional and dynamic tasks through iterative interactions with the environment. Thirdly, due to the complexity of tasks and the differences in resource supply among different vendors, collaboration is required between different vendors to complete tasks. The multi-agent DRL (MADRL) methods are very effective in solving collaborative tasks, where the collaborative tasks can be jointly completed by cloud, edge and terminal devices which provided by different vendors. This survey provides a comprehensive overview regarding the applications of DRL and MADRL in the context of CETCN. The first part of this survey provides a depth overview of the key concepts of the CETCN and the mathematical underpinnings of both DRL and MADRL. Then, we highlight the applications of RL algorithms in solving various challenges within CETCN, such as task offloading, resource allocation, caching and mobility management. In addition, we extend discussion to explore how DRL and MADRL are making inroads into emerging CETCN scenarios like intelligent transportation system (ITS), the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), smart health and digital agriculture. Furthermore, security considerations related to the application of DRL within CETCN are addressed, along with an overview of existing standards that pertain to edge intelligence. Finally, we list several lessons learned in this evolving field and outline future research opportunities and challenges that are critical for the development of the CETCN. We hope this survey will attract more researchers to investigate scalable and decentralized AI algorithms for the design of CETCN.  © 1998-2012 IEEE.","applications; Cloud-edge-terminal collaborative network (CETCN); collaborative caching; mobility management; multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL); network architecture; resource allocation; security; single-agent reinforcement learning (SARL); standards; task offloading","Autonomous agents; Complex networks; Decision making; Deep learning; Edge computing; Fertilizers; Intelligent systems; Iterative methods; Job analysis; Multi agent systems; Reinforcement learning; Resource allocation; Cloud-computing; Cloud-edge-terminal collaborative network; Collaborative caching; Collaborative network; Delay; Federated learning; Mobility management; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Reinforcement learnings; Resource management; Resources allocation; Security; Single-agent; Single-agent reinforcement learning; Task analysis; Task offloading; Network architecture","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184489215"

However, the diversity and pluralism of the plant factory components make it difficult to cooperate and produce crops with better qualities. Therefore, appropriate resource allocation and task scheduling strategies become the key points to optimize the quality of production in the factories by immediately telling which component is more suitable to do what in taking care of the crops. To address this challenge, this paper investigates how the machines of the factory can use their unique services and resource to help improve the crops' quality and model the machine cooperation as an online decision-making problem. An α-competitive approach called OnATS is designed based on the transformation of the original problem, and the experiments show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the baselines.

Limited by power supply and hardware computing capability, applications on edge servers are mostly deployed and run in the form of container microservices to improve resource utilization. Therefore, identifying the power consumption at the container granularity is of great importance for the load scheduling and service quality assurance of edge servers. In this article, a gradient boosting piecewise linear regression tree (GBRT-PL)-based container power prediction method is proposed. Performance metrics with a strong correlation between container and server power consumption are selected for power consumption modeling. To effectively suit the nonlinear relationship between container performance metrics and server power consumption, the integrated predictive capabilities of multiple regression trees (RTs) and the segmented linear model of single RT leaf nodes are applied. The data from the experiments prove that the GBRT-PL model predicts power consumption more accurately than other models for single and multiple container groups. The highest average relative error rate in the four multicontainer group tests is 6.72%, whereas the highest relative error rate in the 90% quantile is 11.66%.

Moreover, MicroService Architecture (MSA) is increasingly adopted to keep up with the rapid development and deployment needs of fast-evolving IoT applications. Due to the fine-grained modularity of the microservices and their independently deployable and scalable nature, MSA exhibits great potential in harnessing Fog and Cloud resources, thus giving rise to novel paradigms like Osmotic computing. The loosely coupled nature of the microservices, aided by the container orchestrators and service mesh technologies, enables the dynamic composition of distributed and scalable microservices to achieve diverse performance requirements of the IoT applications using distributed Fog resources. To this end, efficient placement of microservice plays a vital role, and scalable placement algorithms are required to utilise the said characteristics of the MSA while overcoming novel challenges introduced by the architecture. Thus, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of recent literature on microservices-based IoT applications placement within Fog computing environments. Furthermore, we organise multiple taxonomies to capture the main aspects of the placement problem, analyse and classify related works, identify research gaps within each category, and discuss future research directions.

This study aims to investigate how supply chain relationship quality (SCRQ) and knowledge sharing promote the success of NSD, and examines service modularity as an important contingency factor that enhances NSD performance in supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: Based on service-dominant logic, this study builds a conceptual model to empirically explore the impacts of SCRQ and knowledge sharing on NSD performance, and highlights the moderating effect of service modularity by means of survey methodology of 295 Chinese service firms to test the research hypotheses. Findings: Regression analysis results show that SCRQ has significant positive effects on knowledge sharing and NSD performance; knowledge sharing plays a partial intermediary role between SCRQ and NSD performance; and service modularity partially moderates the relationships between SCRQ, knowledge sharing and NSD performance. Research limitations/implications: Generalizations here are limited to Chinese service firms. Service modularity in manufacturing firms experimenting with servitization has yet to be examined and provides a good avenue for future research. Originality/value: This study contributes to service management literature by providing empirical understanding of how service modularity affects NSD performance in multiprovider contexts.

However, overclocking can significantly degrade component lifetime, increase power draw, and cause power capping events, eventually diminishing the performance benefits. In this paper, we characterize the impact of overclocking on cloud workloads by studying their profiles from production deployments. Based on the characterization insights, we propose SmartOClock, the first distributed overclocking management platform specifically designed for cloud environments. SmartOClock is a workload-aware scheme that relies on power predictions to heterogeneously distribute the power budgets across its servers based on their needs and then enforce budget compliance locally, per-server, in a decentralized manner. SmartOClock reduces the tail latency by 9%, application cost by 30% and total energy consumption by 10% for latencysensitive microservices on a 36-server deployment. Simulation analysis using production traces show that SmartOClock reduces the number of power capping events by up to 95% while increasing the overclocking success rate by up to 62%. We also describe lessons from building a first-of-its-kind overclockable cluster in Microsoft Azure for production experiments. © 2024 IEEE.","","Budget control; Green computing; Windows operating system; Design limits; Improving performance; Management platforms; Overclocking; Performance benefits; Power capping; Power design; Power draw; Risk aware; Server components; Energy utilization","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201157893"

The system features two key components: a side-channel measurement of the energy consumption and a GAN model to learn the data patterns during normal operations only. Anomalies in energy consumption during online testing are then discovered as outliers to the normal data by scrutinizing the anomaly score produced by the discriminator of the GAN model. This semi-supervised network circumvents the need for vast data labeling and exploits the overfitting during the training stage, hence magnifying the difference between the normal patterns learned in training and the unobserved abnormal energy profiles in testing. Moreover, considering the physical aspects of the robotic manipulator, a modified GAN architecture containing multiple discriminators to account for distinct contributions from individual joints/motors. A dynamic thresholding approach that continuously updates the statistical characteristics of the anomaly score is also developed to detect outliers and mitigate the effect of environmental variations during system operation.

Similar modularity concepts might also translate beneficially to machine learning, uncovering equivalent benefits, such as reuse opportunities. We address the research problem of modular neural networks’ (MNNs) applicability, operations, and comparability to monolithic solutions. A systematic literature review is used to identify 86 studies that provide information regarding modularity compared to monolithic solutions. The selected studies address many tasks and domains, evidencing broad applicability, although applied modularity operations are limited mainly to splitting. Nearly two-thirds of studies show improvements in task accuracy compared to monolithic solutions. Only 16% of studies report performance values in their comparisons, but 82% report MNN performance benefits in training and inference time, memory, and energy consumption compared to monolithic solutions. However, publication bias can favor MNNs, and most studies were conducted in laboratory environments on focused tasks and static requirements. Nevertheless, we conclude that MNNs perform at least satisfactorily compared to monolithic solutions. Modularity can bring forth benefits for managing complexity and has the potential for development and operations performance efficiency.

However, due to suffering from challenges such as faults their applications may be limited in real practice. So, in designing wearable devices, designer must take into account fault tolerance techniques. This study aims to investigate the challenging issues of fault tolerance in wearable computing. For this purpose, different aspects of fault tolerance in wearable computing namely hardware, software, energy, and communication are studied; and state of the art research regarding each category is analysed. In this analysis, the performed works using the fault tolerance techniques are included in the form of 25 components and referred to as “fault tolerance plan”. Using this fault tolerance plan and the appropriate profile, the fault tolerance of any wearable system can be evaluated. In this article, fault tolerances of several of the most prominent works conducted in the field of wearable computing were evaluated.

As video file movement over communication systems continues to rise, the existing connection capacity struggles to retain pace, leading to poor service quality, including long buffering times and intermittent disruptions. This study offers AMES-Cloud, an adaptive communication systems video running and allocating platform, in response to this difficulty. AMES-Cloud archives videos effectively and is utilized in cloud computing to develop isolated agents for specific mobile users. By utilising Scalable Video Coding algorithms, these agents can adapt to changing link quality and provide uninterrupted video streaming. Furthermore, by employing background pushing features across several components, including VB, subVBs, and localVB AMES-Cloud hopes to offer mobile consumers smooth video streaming experiences. Through a prototype implementation and evaluation, AMES-Cloud demonstrates significant improvements in mobile streaming adaptability, leveraging cloud computing techniques.

Moving one step ahead, collaborative edge caching is proposed to facilitate preserving user privacy via reducing the external data exposure. However, it still fails to avert the risk of privacy leakage from nearby edge devices. To tackle this issue, we develop an analytical framework for privacy preserving joint communication and content allocation algorithm for distributed collaborative edge caching systems, in which edge devices collaboratively cache and share the content items based on the dummy-based privacy preservation mechanism. Specifically, we define the system request uncertainty criterion from the perspective of information entropy to measure the privacy preservation performance. Consequently, the closed-form relationship between the system request uncertainty and the resource allocation decisions on both communication resources and content items can be derived. Then, we decompose the NP-hard resource management problem into two parts, and propose 1) an optimal dummy request allocation strategy through investigating special properties of the maximal allocation reward gain and 2) an asymptotically optimal content item allocation strategy with low complexity based on the extract penalty method (EPM), which are iterated to obtain a viable solution, followed by the proof of convergence and asymptotic monotone property. Finally, the performance improvements are verified by simulations.  © 2014 IEEE.","Collaborative edge caching; dummy-based method; privacy preserving; resource allocation","Constrained optimization; Information management; Privacy-preserving techniques; Collaboration; Collaborative edge caching; Device-to-Device communications; Dummy-based method; Edge caching; Privacy; Privacy preserving; Resource management; Resources allocation; Systems performance; Resource allocation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200252633"

When burst requests are coming to be satisfied, there may exist edge devices which are overloaded, since requests are mostly spatially and temporally constrained, and edge devices are resource-scarceness and capacity-limited. In this setting, overloaded devices should be relieved through optimally migrating one or more activated services to contiguous edge devices. Besides, sensory data gathered by original edge devices should be periodically transmitted to migrated devices for data analysis purpose. To mitigate this issue, this article proposes an energy-efficient online service migration (EOSM) mechanism to conduct the migration of multiple services simultaneously. Specifically, a light service sharing strategy is developed to only transmit the top container layer, and a modified nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II algorithm is adopted to generate one or multiple paths for the container layer and time-series sensory data migration of each migrated service. Extensive experimental results show that our EOSM strategy outperforms the state of arts techniques in mitigating overloading devices in terms of access latency, energy consumption, and request success rate.  © 2024 IEEE.","Edge networks; layered docker container; service migration; time-series data migration","Containers; Edge computing; Edge detection; Energy efficiency; Internet of things; Time series analysis; Cloud-computing; Data-migration; EDGE Networks; Energy-consumption; Image edge detection; Layered docker container; Service migration; Task analysis; Time-series data; Time-series data migration; Energy utilization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194846114"

As the ICT sector transitions from traditional cloud computing to edge cloud to enhance proximity, it has adopted hypervisor-based virtualization. The emergence of beyond 5G systems, characterized by the need for autonomous orchestration, decentralized processing, ultra-low latency, and high throughput, necessitates a shift towards a distributed cloud system with autonomous functionalities. This infrastructure enables proactive control and management of network functions, allowing the delivery of services and microservices through a preconfigured setup at the edge. In regions prone to geographical instability, where network integrity can be compromised by natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis, establishing a robust, self-managing network is crucial. Such a network should be capable of independently providing services using local resources, functioning autonomously without external reliance, and effectively managing itself. This paper introduces NerveNet-VNF, a concept focusing on container-based virtualization of network functions. This system is coupled with SDN technology and integrated with a Dynamic Load Balancing (D-LB) system within a distributed cloud architecture. This integrated solution enables the hosting, management, and provisioning of local microservice requirements. Additionally, it introduces a new concept for splitting network functionality based on containers compared to the traditional abstract splitting system. Evaluation of this system demonstrates improvements in latency and throughput. Notably, there is a 20% reduction in NerveNet-VNF request execution time compared to the pre-existing NerveNet network. Moreover, integrating the distributed SDN controller technique into the distributed cloud system (HEC) has reduced latency by 88.91% and improved throughput by 28.48%. © 2013 IEEE.","5G; autonomous orchestrator systems; D-LB; Edge cloud; HEC; K3s; local data delivery; mininet; NerveNet-VNF; OpenDayLight; SDN; VNF","Benchmarking; Cloud platforms; Decision making; Distributed cloud; Information management; Mobile edge computing; Network function virtualization; Plastic bottles; Quality of service; 5g; Autonomous orchestrator system; Data delivery; Dynamic load balancing; Edge clouds; HEC; K3s; Local data; Local data delivery; Mininet; Nervenet-VNF; Opendaylight; SDN; VNF; 5G mobile communication systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203638781"

Fog/Edge computing is a promising and distributed computing paradigm that has drawn extensive attention from both industry and academia. The infrastructural efficiency of these computing paradigms necessitates adaptive resource management mechanisms for offloading decisions and efficient scheduling. Resource Management (RM) is a non-trivial issue whose complexity is the result of heterogeneous resources, incoming transactional workload, edge node discovery, and Quality of Service (QoS) parameters at the same time, which makes the efficacy of resources even more challenging. Hence, the researchers have adopted Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based techniques to resolve the above-mentioned issues. This paper offers a comprehensive review of resource management issues and challenges in Fog/Edge paradigm by categorizing them into provisioning of computing resources, task offloading, resource scheduling, service placement, and load balancing. In addition, existing AI and non-AI based state-of-the-art solutions have been discussed, along with their QoS metrics, datasets analysed, limitations and challenges. The survey provides mathematical formulation corresponding to each categorized resource management issue.

Digital economy has emerged as a prominent driver of sustainable development worldwide. It plays a crucial role in environmental sustainability, economic expansion, and social progress. This study primarily examines the role of the digital economy in facilitating sustainable regional development (SRD). Furthermore, this study examines the moderating effect of digital financial inclusion on the relationship between digitalization and SRD. Panel data from 30 Chinese provinces spanning the period 2011 to 2021 were utilized for this analysis. Digital economy (Digi-E) and SRD were measured using the panel entropy method and principal component analysis. SRD considers three main dimensions of sustainable development: the economic, environmental, and social sustainability of the provinces. The spatial Durbin dynamic model and spatial regression were used to analyze the data. The findings revealed that Digi-E significantly affected SRD, with a marginal effect of 0.297. Similarly, digital financial inclusion significantly and positively moderates the relationship between Digi-E and SRD. The spatial Durbin dynamic model also showed that Digi-E has a significant effect on SRD when both types of weights are considered, such as economic geography and geographic distance. Moreover, it was confirmed that the SRD in the previous year significantly contributed to the SRD in subsequent years, and that the SRD in the local region also significantly contributed to the SRD of the adjacent region. Spatial regression also revealed a significantly positive impact of the interaction terms Digi-E and digital financial inclusion on SRD. Thus, Digi-E can contribute significantly to sustainable regional development both individually and through digital financial inclusion. The new economic growth and development plan requires governments to drive the digital revolution and improve the infrastructure. Governments should increase digital financial services with a focus on rural monitoring. © 2024, HARD Publishing Company.

Deep learning-based methods have emerged as the dominant approach in this field, exhibiting exceptional performance. However, most existing methods lack the ability to quantify confidence, limiting their practical decision-making utility. To address this limitation, we propose a novel denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM)-based method, termed WorkloadDiff, for multivariate probabilistic workload prediction. WorkloadDiff leverages both original and noisy signals from input conditions using a two-path neural network. Additionally, we introduce a multi-scale feature extraction method and an adaptive fusion approach to capture diverse temporal patterns within the workload. To enhance consistency between conditions and predicted values, we incorporate a resampling strategy into the inference of WorkloadDiff. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of WorkloadDiff over all baseline models, establishing it as a robust tool for resource management in cloud data centers.  © 2013 IEEE.","Cloud workload prediction; diffusion models; resampling; resource management","Cloud data centers; Cloud workload prediction; Condition; De-noising; Diffusion model; Performance; Probabilistic models; Resampling; Resource management; Workload predictions; Prediction models","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204729886"

This compelling need to obtain a unified view of information associated with Smart Products has stimulated the so-called Internet of Services (IoS) paradigm, allowing for the sharing of products data and the execution of functions among various participants in intertwined supply chains. In these contexts, service-oriented architectures are being more and more employed to meet the complex and ever-evolving data analysis requirements, particularly when implementing Digital Thread solutions for Smart Products, where several issues must be considered, ranging from the heterogeneity of (Big) data to data sovereignty and data access policies, as information may cross the borders of multiple actors participating in intertwined supply chains.

NFV decouples network functions from hardware devices. This decoupling allows network services, called Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs), to be hosted on commodity hardware which simplifies and enhances service deployment and management for providers, improves flexibility, and leads to efficient and scalable resource usage, and lower costs. The proper placement of VNFs in the hosting infrastructures is one of the main technical challenges. This placement significantly influences the network's performance, reliability, and operating costs. The VNF placement is NP-Hard. Therefore, there is a need for placement methods that can cope with the complexity of the problem and find appropriate solutions in a reasonable duration. The primary purpose of this study is to provide a taxonomy of optimization techniques used to tackle the VNF placement problems. We classify the studied papers based on performance metrics, methods, algorithms, and environment. Virtualization is not limited to simply replacing physical machines with virtual machines or VNFs, but may also include micro-services, containers, and cloud-native systems. In this context, the second part of our article focuses on the placement of Containers Network Functions (CNFs) in edge/fog computing.

In addressing these hurdles, container technology emerges as a crucial solution, particularly in mitigating deployment and security issues. However, the impact of GPU acceleration on containerized computer vision applications remains understudied. This paper explores containerized computer vision applications across ARM edge devices, analyzing performance on different CPUs and GPUs. Insights cover processing time, CPU usage, memory utilization, and application performance, highlighting the importance of ARM processor selection. Integrating CPU and GPU enhances execution time but leads to significant memory usage increases. Workload escalation strains the GPU, resulting in slowed processing, and its performance becomes comparable to that of the CPU.

The processor is designed to energy-efficiently execute network functions frequently used by datacenter applications. With such a processor, the SNIC has promised to notably improve the system-wide energy efficiency of datacenter servers. Nevertheless, the latest trend of integrating accelerators into server CPUs for these functions sparks a question on the SNIC processor's superiority over a host processor (i.e., server CPU with accelerators) in system-wide energy efficiency, especially under given tail latency constraints. Answering this question, we first take an Intel Xeon processor, integrated with various accelerators (e.g., QuickAssist Technology), as a host processor, and then compare it to an NVIDIA BlueField-2 SNIC processor. This uncovers that (1) the host accelerator, coupled with a more powerful memory subsystem, can outperform the SNIC accelerator, and (2) the SNIC processor can improve system-wide energy efficiency only at low packet rates for most functions under tail latency constraints. To provide high system-wide energy efficiency without compromising tail latency at any packet rates, we propose HAL, consisting of a hardware-based load balancer and an intelligent load balancing policy implemented inside the SNIC. When HAL determines that the SNIC processor cannot efficiently process a given function beyond a specific packet rate, it limits the rate of packets to the SNIC processor and lets the host processor handle the excess. We implement a HAL-enabled SNIC with a commodity FPGA and a BlueField-2 SNIC, plug it into a commodity server, and run 10 popular network functions. Our evaluation shows that HAL can improve the system-wide energy efficiency and throughput of the server running these functions by 31% and 10%, respectively, without notably increasing the tail latency. © 2024 IEEE.","","Balancing; Computer hardware; Electric loads; Network function virtualization; Program processors; Transfer functions; Cooperative computing; Datacenter; Energy; Energy efficient; Hardware-assisted; Latency constraints; Load-Balancing; Network functions; Packet rate; System-wide energy efficiency; Energy efficiency","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201146595"

The framework is specifically designed to recognize patterns and abnormalities that may suggest prospective engine problems in real-time and allow proactive maintenance. We assessed the performance of the developed vehicular engine health monitoring systems using a deep learning model based on essential measures like root mean square error, root mean square deviation, mean absolute error, accuracy, confusion matrix, and area under the curve. In this case, the deep learning models are developed by following ensemble techniques using the most prominently used machine learning techniques.

Anomaly detection algorithm is often used as the main method of sensor data detection. The development and application of IoT technology has led to a significant increase in data traffic. However, current anomaly detection methods are difficult to effectively detect heterogeneous data sequences from multiple sources. In this study, the sensor monitoring model of an intelligent greenhouse is constructed by using the spatio-temporal correlation anomaly detection algorithm in edge computing. The data is chunked by a sliding window to reduce the error of one-sided estimation of single data on the detection results. The spatial correlation anomaly detection algorithm is formed on the basis of the temporal correlation detection algorithm, fusing the two algorithms with the edge computation to construct a multi-source multi-dimensional data anomaly detection model. The results of the time-related anomaly detection algorithm experiment showed that the F1-score of the algorithm was 91.26%. Compared with other methods, the false alarm rate of spatial correlation anomaly detection algorithm was reduced by 56.50% ~ 83.45%, and F1-score was increased by 1.37% ~ 22.25%. In the case of big data, the detection time of the sensor monitoring model was 0.47s, the required energy consumption was reduced by 36.75% ~ 79.20%, and the delay time was the least. The anomaly detection algorithm in this study is related to time and space, which effectively improves the detection rate and detection accuracy, thus reducing the computing load of the cloud platform, and is superior to the deep learning method in processing delay.  © 2013 IEEE.","anomaly detection; cloud computing; Sensor monitoring techniques; sliding window; spatio-temporal correlation","Anomaly detection; Anomaly-detection algorithms; Cloud-computing; Edge computing; Monitoring models; Monitoring techniques; Sensor monitoring; Sensor monitoring technique; Sliding Window; Spatiotemporal correlation; Spatio-temporal data","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201488196"

Owing to this technological advancement, manufacturing tools that can communicate with each other through the Internet of Things are now able to collect real-time data.

One of the most critical issues in 5G is how to support dynamically arriving mission-critical services with low-latency and high-reliability requirements in distributed edge environments. However, most existing works focus on how to provide reliable services without considering latency, and their heuristics struggle to cope with high-dimensional constraints and complex environments with heterogeneous infrastructure and services. In this paper, we propose a SafeDRL algorithm to resource-efficiently support these dynamically arriving services while meeting their reliability and latency requirements. Specifically, we first formulate the problem as an integer nonlinear programming and prove its NP-hardness. To tackle this problem, our SafeDRL algorithm captures delayed rewards in dynamic environments by reinforcement learning, and corrects constraint violations with high-quality feasible solutions based on expert intervention, and prunes unnecessary backup instances for optimality. The algorithm is proved to have a bounded approximation ratio in general cases. Extensive trace-driven simulations show that, compared with the state-of-the-art solution, SafeDRL can save resource costs by up to 49.32% and improve the service acceptance ratio by up to 55% with acceptable execution time. © 2023 IEEE.","5G; deep reinforcement learning; edge computing; mission-critical services; network function virtualization","5G mobile communication systems; Approximation algorithms; Deep learning; Edge computing; Integer programming; Nonlinear programming; Reinforcement learning; Reliability; Transfer functions; Virtual reality; 5g; Critical issues; Critical service; Deep reinforcement learning; Edge computing; Key technologies; Mission critical; Mission-critical service; Monolithics; Reinforcement learnings; Network function virtualization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181133043"

The quality of service (QoS) should be guaranteed, and the resource cost should be controlled. Therefore, a method to accurately measure computing power consumption becomes a key research issue for improving resource utilization and keeping the load pressure in the acceptable range. Due to mature virtualization technologies and developing parallel technologies, the traditional estimation metric CPU utilization fails to address interference caused by resource competition, thus leading to accuracy loss. However, the hyper-threading (HT) technology is employed as the main data center processor, which makes it urgent to estimate the computing power of HT processors. To address this estimation challenge, this study proposes the APU method to estimate the computing power consumption for HT processors based on the understanding of the HT running mechanism and thread behavior modeling. Considering that users with different authorities can access different system levels, two implementation schemes are put forward: one based on the hardware support and the other based on the operating system (OS). The proposed method adopts CPU utilization as the input without demands for other dimensions. Additionally, it reduces the development and deployment costs of new monitoring tools without the support of special hardware architectures, thereby making the method universal and easy to apply. Finally, SPEC benchmarks further prove the effectiveness of the method. The estimation errors of the three benchmarks are reduced from 20%, 50%, and 20% to less than 5%. For further proving the applicability, the APU method is leveraged to ByteDance clusters for showing its effects in case studies. © 2023 Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Given the frequent mobility of users, it is essential to migrate services to continuously align with user movements. However, making service migration decisions requires careful consideration of factors like latency, resource availability, and user demand to ensure optimal performance and user satisfaction. Therefore, in this paper, we first formulate the service migration in MEC systems as an optimization problem, with the objective of minimizing the system’s energy consumption and migration cost while considering delay as the model's constraint. Next, we propose an energy-efficient, cost-effective and QoS-aware heuristic-based method, called ECQ, to effectively solve the model. To reflect a comprehensive understanding of real-world MEC environments, we also consider the incorporation of heterogeneous server configurations and the non-universal presence of servers across all base stations. By accommodating these aspects, ECQ emerges as a promising solution for the dynamic service migration optimization challenges in time-sensitive and realistic MEC contexts. Finally, through various simulation scenarios, the performance of the proposed ECQ is evaluated in terms of response time, migration costs, energy consumption, and the number of migrations. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other methods in terms of overall performance; specifically, it ensures high QoS for users while sustainably managing the system's energy consumption and keeping migration costs within acceptable levels. In particular, when compared to the FullMig strategy, the proposed method achieves a noteworthy reduction in migration costs and energy consumption by approximately 25% and 50%, respectively. Meanwhile, the average response time in FullMig is only about 12% less than that of our method. Additionally, in comparison to the E-ware method, our ECQ exhibits an impressive response time reduction of approximately 42%, all while maintaining migration costs and energy consumption at levels comparable to the E-ware approach. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Energy consumption; Heuristic algorithm; Migration cost; Mobile edge computing (MEC); Quality of service (QoS); Service migration","Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Energy efficiency; Green computing; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Mobile edge computing; Optimization; Quality of service; Cost effective; Efficient costs; Energy efficient; Energy-consumption; Heuristics algorithm; Migration costs; Mobile edge computing; Quality of service; Quality-of-service; Service migration; Energy utilization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185979468"

The constantly changing IoV data under varying traffic conditions made it unsuitable for the IoV to adopt traditional anti-attack techniques. In the absence of protections, attackers can use in-car communication as a target to compromise the safety of passengers, hence the instancy to detect the security state of the IoV. However, currently available solutions require modifications to the original hardware of the IoV and are therefore very limited in applicability. In this paper, we propose a security assessment method for IoV based on Microcontroller Unit (MCU) chip temperature, called SAMCT. Specifically, we first record the MCU chip temperatures of IoV device in different security states and analyze the relationship between them. Second, the fingerprint dataset is built using the temperature residuals. Third, to forecast the security standing of IoV devices, an integration regression model based on Self-Encoders is suggested. Lastly, in order to facilitate the effectiveness of the SAMCT, a Cloud-Edge-End framework is designed with the technology of model adaptive partitioning. Results from the experiments, which were carried out on the Raspberry Pi 4B and Stm32 hardware platforms, demonstrate that the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the SAMCT is only 0.00104 and that the execution efficiency improvement under the Cloud-Edge-End framework is significant.  © 2023 IEEE.","efficiency enhancement; fingerprint; Internet of Vehicles; regression model; secutity assessment","Deep learning; Efficiency; Mean square error; Microcontrollers; Palmprint recognition; Regression analysis; Vehicles; Efficiency enhancement; Features extraction; Fingerprint; Fingerprint Recognition; Hardware; Internet of vehicle; Objects recognition; Predictive models; Regression modelling; Security; Secutity assessment; Object recognition","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173375040"

IoT devices with various sensors and actuators generate vast amounts of data that can be harnessed to derive valuable insights. The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has ushered in an era of unprecedented data generation and connectivity. These IoT devices, equipped with many sensors and actuators, continuously produce vast volumes of data. However, the conventional approach of transmitting all this data to centralized cloud infrastructures for processing and analysis poses significant challenges. However, transmitting all this data to a centralized cloud infrastructure for processing and analysis can be inefficient and impractical due to bandwidth limitations, network latency, and scalability issues. This paper proposed a Self-Learning Internet Traffic Fuzzy Classifier (SLItFC) for traffic data analysis. The proposed techniques effectively utilize clustering and classification procedures to improve classification accuracy in analyzing network traffic data. SLItFC addresses the intricate task of efficiently managing and analyzing IoT data traffic at the edge. It employs a sophisticated combination of fuzzy clustering and self-learning techniques, allowing it to adapt and improve its classification accuracy over time. This adaptability is a crucial feature, given the dynamic nature of IoT environments where data patterns and traffic characteristics can evolve rapidly. With the implementation of the fuzzy classifier, the accuracy of the clustering process is improvised with the reduction of the computational time. SLItFC can reduce computational time while maintaining high classification accuracy. This efficiency is paramount in edge computing, where resource constraints demand streamlined data processing. Additionally, SLItFC’s performance advantages make it a compelling choice for organizations seeking to harness the potential of IoT data for real-time insights and decision-making. With the Self-Learning process, the SLItFC model monitors the network traffic data acquired from the IoT Devices. The Sugeno fuzzy model is implemented within the edge computing environment for improved classification accuracy. Simulation analysis stated that the proposed SLItFC achieves 94.5% classification accuracy with reduced classification time. © 2024 Tech Science Press.

To overcome these issues, a wide variety of sharding models are proposed by researchers, but most of these models either generate a larger number of shards, compromise on quality of service (QoS), or reduce security under a larger number of attacks. These issues were minimised in this text via design of an augmented deep Q-learning model for mining optimisation via hybrid-bioinspired blockchain shards and contextual consensus. The model initially collects minimal IIoT information sets from the network-under-deployment, and uses them to select miner nodes. This is done by enforcing two novel consensus models, which are proof-of-spatial trust (PoST) and proof-of-temporal trust (PoTT), that enable the network to identify miner nodes with good spatial and temporal efficiency levels. The selected miner nodes are reconfigured via a bacterial foraging Optimisation (BFO) process, which assists in selecting communication-specific encryption and hashing techniques for security of underlying blocks. The secured blocks are then stored on a set of spatially optimised blockchain shards. Shard configurations are decided by a deep Q-learning-based genetic algorithm (DQGA), which assists in deciding optimal shard length and merging temporally unused shards. These decisions allow the proposed model to reduce mining delay by up to 8.3% when compared with existing sharding models.

At the same time, digitalization introduces new possibilities to leverage the untapped optimization potential to provide this flexibility. Mathematical optimization methods such as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) are widely used to predict optimal operation plans for industrial systems. MILP models are difficult to adapt, but the viability of the predicted plans relies on accurate underlying models of the actual behavior. New automation paradigms, such as the digital twin (DT), can overcome these current drawbacks. In this work, we present the implementation and experimental evaluation of several micro-services on a standardized five-dimensional DT platform that automate MILP model adaption and operation optimization. These micro-services guarantee that, (1) deviations between the physical entity and its virtual entity models are detected, (2) the models are adapted accordingly, (3) subsequently linearized to suit the MILP approach and (4) used for live operational optimization. These novel services and DT workflows that orchestrate them were experimentally tested with a packed bed thermal energy storage (PBTES) test rig that acts as a physical entity. A waste heat recovery use case in steel production is used as the evaluation scenario. While the model error of a static simulation model would increase to 60% over 7 days of operation, the model error remains well below 25% as a result of successful model adaption. The prediction error of the optimization model remains in a typical magnitude of 10 to 20% during the evaluation period, despite the degradation of the PBTES power. © 2023 The Author(s)","Digital twin (DT); Iron and steel industry; Mixed integer linear programming (MILP); Operation optimization; Thermal energy storage; Waste heat recovery","Errors; Heat storage; Integer programming; Iron and steel industry; Packed beds; Steelmaking; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Digital twin; Integer Linear Programming; Micro services; Mixed integer linear; Mixed integer linear programming; Mixed integer linear programming model; Operations optimization; Steel production; Thermal energy storage; Waste-heat recovery; alternative energy; energy storage; iron and steel industry; linear programing; optimization; waste management; Thermal energy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175337178"

Despite the widespread use of network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), the issue of false positives remains prevalent. Furthermore, few studies have approached the intrusion detection problem as a time series issue, requiring time series modeling. In this study, we propose a novel technique for the early detection of intrusions in cloud computing using time series data. Our approach involves a method for Feature Selection (FS) and a prediction model based on the Facebook Prophet model to assess its efficiency. The FS method we propose is a collaborative feature selection model that integrates time series analysis techniques with anomaly detection, stationary, and causality tests. This approach specifically addresses the challenge of misleading connections between time series anomalies and attacks. Our results demonstrate a significant reduction in predictors employed in our prediction model, from 70 to 10 predictors, while improving performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Median Absolute Percentage Error (MdAPE), and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Furthermore, our approach has resulted in reduced training, prediction, and cross-validation times of approximately 85%, 15%, and 97%, respectively. Although memory consumption remains similar, the utilization time has been significantly reduced, resulting in substantial resource usage reduction. Overall, our study presents a comprehensive methodology for effective early detection of intrusions in cloud computing based on time series anomalies, employing a collaborative feature selection model and the Facebook Prophet prediction model.

Fog computing is a novel computing approach for various IoT applications, specifically time-sensitive.

But most of these models are either unsalable due to their QoS (Quality of Service) performance under large loads, or showcase lower attack detection efficiency for heterogeneous attacks. Methods: To overcome these issues, this text proposes the design of a novel iterative learning contextual-sidechaining model for improving the security of priority-aware cloud resources. The proposed model initially uses a single-chained blockchain, which is split into multiple sidechains via Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO). These sidechains are reconfigured via a Bacterial Foraging Optimizer (BFO), which assists in deciding encryption and hashing techniques for individual chains. The BFO Model uses a resource-level priority metric, which assists in deciding the level of security and QoS for individual sidechains. The model is further extended by a Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO) which assists in iteratively optimizing the GWO & BFO Models for QoS & Security enhancements. Results: Due to these enhancements, the proposed model is able to improve multiple QoS metrics even under heterogeneous attacks. The proposed model was tested under Sybil, distributed denial of service, masquerading, and spoofing attacks with multiple communication configurations. Conclusion: It was observed that the model was able to reduce the delay needed for communication by 8.5 %, improve the energy efficiency by 3.9 %, and increase the throughput by 4.5 %, and improve the request processing performance by 2.5 % under large-scale requests. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Attacks; Blockchain; Cloud; Deployment; Iterative; Side chaining","Cryptography; Denial-of-service attack; Energy efficiency; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Network security; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Quality of service; Attack; Bacterial foraging; Block-chain; Deployment; Gray wolves; Iterative; Iterative learning; Optimizers; Side chaining; Side-chains; Blockchain","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174173612"

We introduced an automated system capable of regulating the internal greenhouse environment, which underwent testing across 30 days in September 2021, with temperatures ranging from 26°C to 31°C and humidity from 65% to 70%. The system consistently monitored and adjusted the microclimate, with sensors capturing temperature and humidity data at 30-second intervals, amassing over 83,000 data entries for enhanced control accuracy. The automated regulation effectively maintained desired humidity, significantly reducing nighttime levels by 80% while carefully increasing daytime humidity to counteract external heat. Temperature control was largely successful, sustaining daytime levels around 32°C, but faced challenges in maintaining the target of 26°C during cooler nights. Energy consumption was optimized, with the automation leading to a significant 4–33% energy saving for cooling and an 8% saving in heating compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the system was accessible via a web interface, allowing for real-time climate tracking and prompt anomaly identification. In conclusion, the developed greenhouse automation system exhibited efficiency in equipment usage and improved temperature and humidity control.

To this end, a hybrid sensing method is proposed to understand the mechanical responses of tunnel lining to the construction loads via a wireless sensor network (WSN) and machine learning algorithms. Firstly, the displacement of tunnel lining is monitored in real-time during construction by using the WSN. The rotation of the whole segmental ring is found for the first time based on the in-situ data. A refined three-dimensional numerical model is then applied to investigate the additional stress of segmental rings under such a new deformation mode. Subsequently, a scenario-based construction database is established, including 130 numerical cases of load conditions. For the dynamic control of shield tunneling, an efficient multi-layer perception surrogate model is proposed with the help of the established database. The additional stress state of segmental rings is sensed on-site in a hybrid mode efficiently, both from real structural responses via WSN and the construction parameters via surrogate model. Meanwhile, the construction parameters can be adjusted timely if the additional stress exceeds its limit. For the case study of this paper, with the measured maximum ring rotation at 0.25° and the maximum arc length of circumferential misalignment between two adjacent rings at 7.1 mm, an additional rotation-induced stress of 19.34*103 kN/m2, i.e., 39% of the concrete compressive strength, is found for the first time at longitudinal bolt holes of segmental rings, which has not been considered but should be emphasized in the future design practice. © 2023","3D simulation; Segment deformation; Shield tunnel; Surrogate model; Wireless sensor network","Compressive strength; Learning algorithms; Numerical models; Rotation; Shielding; Supervised learning; Tunnel linings; 3D simulations; Additional stress; Construction loads; Construction parameter; Induced stress; Segment deformation; Shield tunnel; Shield tunnelling; Structural response; Surrogate modeling; compressive strength; computer simulation; deformation mechanism; future prospect; loading test; numerical model; stress field; structural analysis; structural response; three-dimensional modeling; tunnel design; tunnel lining; tunneling; Wireless sensor networks","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165225885"

To develop sustainability-aware software, green metrics have been implemented to estimate the energy consumed by the execution of an application. However, they have a rebound energy consumption effect because they require an application to be executed to estimate the energy consumed after each change. To address this problem, it is necessary to construct energy estimation models that do not require the execution of applications. This work addresses this problem by constructing a green model based on size, complexity and duplicated lines to estimate the energy consumed by model-view-controller applications without their execution.

Docker Swarm is a container orchestration tool for managing a cluster of Docker containers and their hosts. However, Docker Swarm’s scheduler does not consider resource utilization when placing containers in a cluster. This paper first investigated performance interference in container clusters. Our experimental study showed that distributed applications’ performance can be degraded when co-located with other containers which aggressively consume resources. A new scheduler is proposed to improve performance while keeping high resource utilization.

To understand and manage software under development and maintenance better, several maintainability measures have been proposed. The Maintainability Index is commonly used as a quantitative measure of the relative ease of software maintenance. There are several Index variants that differ in the factors affecting maintainability (e.g., code complexity, software size, documentation) and their given importance. To explore the variants and understand how they compare when evaluating software maintainability, an experiment was conducted with 45 Java-based object-oriented software systems. The results showed that the choice of the variant could influence the perception of maintainability. Although different variants presented different values when subjected to the same software, their values were strongly positively correlated and generally indicated similarly how maintainability evolved between releases and over the long term. Though, when focusing on fine-grained results posed by the Index, the variant selection had a larger impact. Based on their characteristics, behavior, and interrelationships, the variants were divided into two distinct clusters, i.e., variants that do not consider code comments in their calculation and those that do. © 2023 by the authors.","Java; Maintainability Index; maintainability measurement; object-oriented software; software maintenance; software metrics","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149982058"

These federations (often referred to as the Cloud-Edge Continuum) are the foundation upon which most modern digital systems depend, and consume enormous amounts of energy. This consumption is becoming a critical issue as society's energy challenges grow, and is a great concern for power grids which must balance the needs of clouds against other users. The Continuum is highly dynamic, mobile, and complex; new methods to improve energy efficiency must be based on formal scientific models that identify and take into account a huge range of heterogeneous components, interactions, stochastic properties, and (potentially contradictory) service-level agreements and stakeholder objectives. Currently, few formal models of federated Cloud-Edge systems exist - and none adequately represent and integrate energy considerations (e.g. multiple providers, renewable energy sources, pricing, and the need to balance consumption over large-areas with other non-Cloud consumers, etc.). This paper conducts a systematic analysis of current approaches to modelling Cloud, Cloud-Edge, and federated Continuum systems with an emphasis on the integration of energy considerations. We identify key omissions in the literature, and propose an initial high-level architecture and approach to begin addressing these - with the ultimate goal to develop a set of integrated models that include data centres, edge devices, fog nodes, energy providers, software workloads, end users, and stakeholder requirements and objectives. We conclude by highlighting the key research challenges that must be addressed to enable meaningful energy-aware Cloud-Edge Continuum modelling and simulation.  © 2023 IEEE.","brown energy; cloud computing; Continuum; edge computing; fog computing; green energy; modelling","Continuum mechanics; Edge computing; Energy efficiency; Fog; Green computing; Power management; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Brown energy; Cloud-computing; Continuum; Edge computing; Energy; Energy aware; Energy considerations; Formal modeling; Green energy; Modeling; Fog computing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174930280"

Protecting devices against various security threats is one of the most important challenges in IoT since IoT applications are generally security-critical systems while IoT devices are often poorly secured. For IoT devices, employing security services provided by smart gateways or edge/cloud servers to defend against various threats is an effective way to enhance their security. However, the finite battery energy of devices and the limited fund of device users hinder the wide application of security services in IoT. This necessitates the demand for designing new methodologies to tackle the tradeoff among security, energy, and fund of IoT devices. Therefore, this article attempts to optimize system security of IoT devices under energy and fund constraints. Specifically, to formulate the energy and fund constrained security optimization problem, we first propose a pricing model for the security services provided by the smart gateway. We then formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Since using a solver to address the MILP problem may be time consuming, we leverage the swarm intelligence technique to design a new task scheduling scheme that can efficiently solve the optimization problem. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our proposed MILP and swarm intelligence-based task scheduling algorithms. Simulation results show that our scheme outperforms two state-of-the-art methods in improving system quality of security and guaranteeing schedule feasibility.  © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Energy efficiency; fund; Internet of Things (IoT); mixed-integer linear programming (MILP); security; swarm intelligence; task scheduling","Computation theory; Constrained optimization; Economic and social effects; Gateways (computer networks); Integer programming; Internet of things; Multitasking; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Scheduling algorithms; Swarm intelligence; Fund; Integer Linear Programming; Mixed integer linear; Mixed-integer linear programming; Optimisations; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Security; Swarm optimization; Task analysis; Tasks scheduling; Energy efficiency","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139398954"

A huge number of geo-distributed IoT enabled devices such as smart phones, smart cameras, health care systems, vehicles, etc. are connected to the Internet and manage users’ applications. The IoT applications are generally time sensitive, so that giving them up to Cloud and receiving the response may violate their required deadline, due to distance between user device and centralized Cloud data center and consequently increasing network latency. Fog environment, as an intermediate layer between Cloud and IoT devices, brings a smaller scales of Cloud capabilities closer to user location. Processing real time applications in Fog layer helps more deadlines to be met. Although Fog computing enhances quality of service parameters, limited resources and power of Fog nodes is a challenge in processing applications. Furthermore, the network latency is still an issue for communications between applications’ services and between user device and Fog node, which seriously threatens deadline condition.

An increasing number of companies are involved in the construction of data centers; at the same time, the original cloud service providers are constantly expanding new data centers to meet the needs of users. Therefore, the joint scheduling of multiple data centers has become a difficult problem that cloud service providers must face. Joint scheduling refers to the resource allocation among multiple data centers of a cloud service provider. That is, how can the virtual machine application of cloud users be deployed on the physical machine in multiple data centers. A single data center provisioning strategy can solve the scheduling problem within the data center. However, multiple data centers can make the previous provisioning strategy invalid due to geographical location and other differences. In this paper, the characteristics of different data centers are analyzed and clustered to form a data center consortium. Then, the virtual machine (VM) is classified according to the deadline. As cloud users purchase virtual machine resources from cloud service providers, they are billed by time in most cases. The deadline of the virtual machine refers to the time when the virtual machine ends its service. Then, we analyze the power consumption of the data center and deploy VMs based on the rule of avoiding hotspot deployment of VMs with priority energy consumption. Finally, a cloud service provisioning strategy using data center consortium clustering (PSDC3) is proposed and verified. It can be seen from the results that the algorithm can significantly reduce the number of hotspots and energy consumption of cloud data centers. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Data center consortium; Machine learning; Provisioning strategy; Unsupervised learning","Distributed database systems; Energy utilization; Network security; Virtual machine; Cloud service providers; Cloud services; Clusterings; Data center consortium; Datacenter; Joint scheduling; Machine-learning; Multiple data; Provisioning strategy; Service provisioning; Machine learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149381205"

WoT applications are inescapable in residential homes and communities. The intent behind WoT applications is to increase sustainable development for reducing resource consumption. The Web of Things (WoT) aims to create a decentralized Internet of Things. Edge computing addresses IoT computing demands by reducing the escalation in resource congestion situations. In edge computing data is placed closed to the end users which diverts computation load from the centralized data centers. Furthermore, the dispersed structure balances network traffic and minimizes traffic peaks in IoT networks. Therefore, resulting in reducing transmission delays between edge servers and end users which improves response times for real-time WoT applications. Low battery supply to nodes with enough power resources can increase the lifespan of the individual nodes by moving processing and communication overhead from the nodes. This paper integrates WoT and edge computing and compares their functionalities. In addition, it demonstrates how edge computing enhances WoT performance and concentrates on transmission, storage, and computation aspects.

Particularly, various highly-developed modality sensors devour most of the energy budget, which would make the deployment of M2C for real-world AIoT applications a difficult challenge. To address the above issue, we propose AMG, an innovative HW/SW co-design solution tailored to multi-modal AIoT systems. The key behind AMG is modality gating (throttling) that allows for adaptively sensing and computing modalities for different tasks. This is non-trivial since we must balance situational awareness, energy conservation, and execution latency. AMG achieves our goal with two first-of-its-kind designs. 1) It introduces a novel decoupled modality sensor architecture to support partial throttling of modality sensors. Doing so allows one to greatly save AIoT power but maintains sensor data flow. 2) AMG also features a smart power management strategy based on the new architecture, allowing the device to initialize and tune itself with the optimal configuration. It can predict whether a reasonable degree of accuracy will be satisfied during runtime, and react proactively to remediate the gating process. Extensive evaluation based on our prototype system confirms that AMG improves the AIoT lifespan by 74.5% to 133.7% with the same energy budget while meeting the performance requirements. © 2023 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

SE integrates information and communication technologies into energy systems, optimizing them to meet these challenges effectively. At the core of SE operations are smart meters, playing a fundamental role in ensuring efficient functionality. These devices collect data, which is then leveraged to derive Business Intelligence (BI) for operations across the entire spectrum, from the sensing infrastructure to the cloud, primarily utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT) technology framework. With the increasing complexity of operations and the growing demand for optimization and enhanced functionality, the SE technology stack is evolving to integrate across all layers and domains. This integration has led to the stratification of computational load across IoT layers, intensifying the dependence on smart meter data for BI. Consequently, smart meters themselves have evolved to become more functional and complex. This paper's novelty lies in its comprehensive exploration of the integration of BI with smart meter data. It delves into various aspects, including the different layers of intelligent operations within SE systems, the current state of the art, and diverse implementations of smart meters and their applications across operational locations, ranging from consumers to fog computing. The paper concludes by identifying research gaps and future directions, offering insights into the evolving requirements for the next generation of SE systems and the necessary adaptations in smart metering infrastructure to support these roles.

To supplement cloud services, computationally intensive applications can be distributed on resource-constrained mobile devices by leveraging underutilized nearby resources to meet the latency and bandwidth requirements of application execution. Building upon this premise, it is necessary to investigate idle or underutilized resources that are present at the edge of the network. The utilization of a microservice architecture in IoT application development, with its increased granularity in service breakdown, provides opportunities for improved scalability, maintainability, and extensibility. In this research, the proposed schedule tackles the latency requirements of applications by identifying suitable upward migration of microservices within a multi-tiered fog computing infrastructure. This approach enables optimal utilization of network edge resources. Experimental validation is performed using the iFogSim2 simulator and the results are compared with existing baselines.

To address this problem, we propose a deep similarity learning approach to recommend relevant training data to a target building solely by using a minimal contextual description on it. Contextual descriptions are modeled as user queries. We further propose to ensemble most used machine learning algorithms in the context of predictive modeling.

The digital revolution quickens traditional agricultural methods to boost crop yield while maintaining quality. Previous attempts to successfully move agricultural practitioners toward AI through sensor technology integration failed. In order to facilitate the deployment of a smart farming system with low energy consumption, we therefore suggest an architectural model consisting of four layers: sensor, network, service, and application. Furthermore, a deep learning technique is employed, concentrating on the application layer, to create a fertilizer recommendation system that is in line with the expert's judgment. For farmers' convenience, the results of the entire system are finally shown as a single mobile application. Internet of Things and Machine Learning for Predicting Pesticides and Fertilizers The Agricultural Census of India estimates that 16–17% of the nation's GDP comes from agriculture, which employs 64.5% of its workforce. Despite being the backbone of our nation, agriculture receives very little attention and either little or no development. As the world's second-largest producer of rice, our nation must adapt and concentrate on enhancing agricultural practices to enhance the quality of life for farmers. It is imperative that contemporary technologies be used in agriculture.AI gives farmers access to real-time information that helps them make informed decisions at every level of farming. This wise choice results in fewer product and chemical loss as well as cost and time savings. © 2023 IEEE.","Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Crops; Fertilizer; IoT","Agricultural technology; Deep learning; Energy utilization; Farms; Fertilizers; Internet of things; Learning systems; Low power electronics; Agriculture fertilizers; Architectural modeling; Crop yield; Digital revolution; Farming system; IoT; Low energy consumption; Process management; Sensor technologies; Technology Integration; Crops","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185389406"

These include the need to address complex requirements such as integrating diverse data sources and incorporating geographical data that reflect the physical urban environment. Platforms designed for smart cities hold a pivotal position in materializing these applications, given that they offer a suite of high-level services, which can be repurposed by developers. Although a variety of platforms are available to aid the creation of smart city applications, most fail to couple their services with geographical data, do not offer the ability to execute semantic queries on the available data, and possess restrictions that could impede the development process. This paper introduces SEDIA, a platform for developing smart applications based on diverse data sources, including geographical information, to support a semantically enriched data model for effective data analysis and integration. It also discusses the efficacy of SEDIA in a proof-of-concept smart city application related to air quality monitoring. The platform utilizes ontology classes and properties to semantically annotate collected data, and the Neo4j graph database facilitates the recognition of patterns and relationships within the data. This research also offers empirical data demonstrating the performance evaluation of SEDIA. These contributions collectively advance our understanding of semantically enriched data integration within the realm of smart city applications. © 2023 by the authors.","air pollution; Air Quality Index (AQI); geospatial data; GraphQL; Internet of Things (IoT); Neo4j; semantic enrichment; smart cities","Air quality; Data integration; Internet of things; Pattern recognition; Semantics; Air quality index; Air quality indices; Data-source; Geo-spatial data; Geographical data; Graphql; Internet of thing; Neo4j; Semantic enrichment; Urban environments; Smart city","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169064868"

Fog computing is instrumental to tap into the full potential of NFV by deploying VNFs in close proximity to end-users, thus decreasing the latency significantly. However, the mobility of end-users and the fog nodes, and the limited fog nodes coverage results in service discontinuity and may increase application delay. Application component migration offers great potential to address this issue. In this paper, we propose a component migration strategy in an NFV-based hybrid cloud/fog system considering the mobility of both end-users and fog nodes. We use the Gauss-Markov mobility model and a random walk mobility model for fog nodes and end-user devices, respectively. We modeled the problem mathematically, which minimizes the aggregated weighted function of application delay and cost. However, considering the mobility of both end-users and fog nodes makes the problem quite complex. Hence, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to decide where and when to migrate application components and to achieve rapid decision-making. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs well. It offers favorable convergence and outperforms existing algorithms in terms of application delay and migration costs.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","and network functions virtualization (NFV); Component migration; deep reinforcement learning; fog computing","Decision making; Deep learning; Drones; Edge computing; Fog; Fog computing; Heuristic algorithms; Reinforcement learning; Transfer functions; Application components; Cloud-computing; Component migration; Deep reinforcement learning; Delay; Edge computing; End-users; Heuristics algorithm; Network function virtualization; Reinforcement learnings; Network function virtualization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141437740"

On the other hand, these types of devices usually aim to perform their function using the lowest possible energy, meaning they have certain constraints in terms of performance. Trying to work with these devices in high-availability environments becomes difficult because of those restraints.

However, the intractability in the training of RL and the heterogeneity of network devices have hindered the application of RL in large-scale networks. Moreover, traditional RL algorithms lack mechanisms to share information effectively in a heterogeneous environment, which makes it more difficult for RL algorithms to converge due to the lack of global information. This article focuses on the task offloading problem in a heterogeneous environment. First, we give a formalized representation of the Lyapunov function to normalize both data and virtual energy queue operations. Subsequently, we jointly consider the computing rate and energy consumption in task offloading and then derive the optimization target leveraging Lyapunov optimization. A Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)-based multiple continuous variable decision model is proposed to make the optimal offloading decision in edge computing. Considering the heterogeneous environment, we improve Hetero Federated Learning (HFL) by introducing Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to accelerate the convergence of our DDPG based model. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm accelerates the search for the optimal task offloading decision in heterogeneous environment.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","federated learning; Lyapunov optimization; reinforcement learning; Task offloading","Computation offloading; Job analysis; Reinforcement learning; Computational modelling; Edge computing; Federated learning; Lyapunov optimization; Optimisations; Reinforcement learnings; Resource management; Task analysis; Task offloading; Energy utilization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153382759"

The lack of a system architecture with well-defined Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) poses a significant challenge for developing reusable, modular and scalable applications. This article presents a service-oriented system architecture designed with data-driven smart buildings in mind. The architecture relies on the Zachman framework and consists of seven service categories: 1) existing business applications, 2) new microservice-based applications, 3) databases, 4) integration software, 5) infrastructure services, 6) shared services, and 7) user interfaces. It closely resembles the MACH architectural principles: Microservices, API-first, Cloud-based components, and Headless principles. This architecture is implemented as a proof-of-concept, including three smart building applications. These include a Digital Twin application integrating sensor data with a BIM model, a web application merging real-time sensor data with semantic building graphs, and a data exploration tool using sensor data, the Brick ontology, and Grafana dashboards. Future implementations include real-time control applications such as Model Predictive Control (MPC). The proposed architecture and its implementations provide a blueprint for a reusable, modular, and scalable architecture in the smart building domain.  © 2023 The Authors.","Building Information Modeling; data integration; data-driven buildings; IoT; linked building data; microservices; real-time data acquisition; reference architecture; REST API; solution architecture","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Architectural design; Automation; C (programming language); Computer software reusability; Data acquisition; Data integration; Information management; Information services; Intelligent buildings; Internet of things; Interoperability; Legacy systems; Real time control; Reusability; Semantics; Service oriented architecture (SOA); User interfaces; Applications programming interfaces; Building Information Modelling; Data driven; Data-driven building; Linked building data; Microservice; Real time data acquisition; Reference architecture; REST application programming interface; Solution architectures; Systems architecture; Computer architecture","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174852308"

Many tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, and Facebook as deploying their data centres around the world to provide computation and storage services. The customers either submit their job directly or they take the help of the brokers for the submission of the jobs to the cloud centres. The preliminary aim is to reduce the overall power consumption which was ignored in the early days of cloud development. This was due to the performance expectations from cloud servers as they were supposed to provide all the services through their services layers IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. As time passed and researchers came up with new terminologies and algorithmic architecture for the reduction of power consumption and sustainability, other algorithmic anarchies were also introduced, such as statistical oriented learning and bioinspired algorithms. In this paper, an indepth focus has been done on multiple approaches for migration among virtual machines and find out various issues among existing approaches. The proposed work utilizes elastic scheduling inspired by the smart elastic scheduling algorithm (SESA) to develop a more energy-efficient VM allocation and migration algorithm. The proposed work uses cosine similarity and bandwidth utilization as additional utilities to improve the current performance in terms of QoS.

This work proposes a new smart street lighting system that adaptively changes the street lights' intensity based on traffic and weather conditions and provides a platform for monitoring road conditions and detecting lamp faults. The system transfers the data using the UDP protocol over NBIoT radio technology. It also maintains two-way communication between the luminaires and the central node. In order to ensure real-time response to traffic and avoid dimming delays, each light is locally controlled by a microcontroller based on the sensed traffic and weather data. The measurements of each luminaire are also sent to the central control node to locate lamp faults, detect emergency situations, and, if needed, broadcast on/off messages to the whole network's luminaires. The system was implemented in a suburban street in Ras Al Khaimah. Evaluations proved that the system can locate and detect faulty lamps and vary the light intensity in real time based on traffic. It also resulted in energy savings of up to 55% compared to a normal LED street light network.  © 2023 Maen Takruri et al.","","Energy conservation; Fault detection; Light emitting diodes; Meteorology; Roads and streets; Street lighting; Condition; Design and implementations; Dimming systems; Hybrid control architecture; LED lighting system; Light intensity; Real- time; Road condition; Save energy; Street lighting system; Lighting fixtures","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178382057"

An active challenge of SMS is to satisfy the ever-changing conditions of industries, supply networks, and customer needs. To operate effectively, SMS should be flexible enough to perform automatic or semi-automatic adjustments to manufacturing processes in response to unexpected changes, a feature called context awareness. Recent advances in interpreting context data in the semantic web have permitted SMS to understand the active situation of manufacturing processes.

This type of technique enables data propagation in a collaboratively and efficient manner to boost real-time performance.

However, in reality, these systems can only ensure the control of heating ventilation and air conditioning system systems. Therefore, many other tasks are left to the operator, e.g. evaluating buildings’ performance, detecting abnormal energy consumption, identifying the changes needed to improve efficiency, ensuring the security and privacy of end-users, etc. To that end, there has been a movement for developing artificial intelligence (AI) big data analytic tools as they offer various new and tailor-made solutions that are incredibly appropriate for practical buildings’ management. Typically, they can help the operator in (i) analyzing the tons of connected equipment data; and; (ii) making intelligent, efficient, and on-time decisions to improve the buildings’ performance. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic survey on using AI-big data analytics in BAMSs. It covers various AI-based tasks, e.g. load forecasting, water management, indoor environmental quality monitoring, occupancy detection, etc. The first part of this paper adopts a well-designed taxonomy to overview existing frameworks. A comprehensive review is conducted about different aspects, including the learning process, building environment, computing platforms, and application scenario. Moving on, a critical discussion is performed to identify current challenges. The second part aims at providing the reader with insights into the real-world application of AI-big data analytics. Thus, three case studies that demonstrate the use of AI-big data analytics in BAMSs are presented, focusing on energy anomaly detection in residential and office buildings and energy and performance optimization in sports facilities.

Real-time, accurate troubleshooting is critical for ensuring satisfactory service. Existing troubleshooting solutions adopt ensemble anomaly detection (EAD) to detect anomalies due to its robustness. However, the fixed base classifier parameters in EAD set by expert experience may reduce the efficiency of anomaly detection when faced with different data distributions. Furthermore, the binary results fed to the secondary classifier in EAD cause information loss, leading to compromised accuracy and inaccurate root cause localization. Besides, key performance indicators (KPIs) are crucial for measuring the system performance, but relying on multiple redundant KPIs to identify the root causes of anomalies is time-consuming and error-prone. To address the above issues, we propose a fully automatic troubleshooting system, ATS. A new EAD method is introduced to detect anomalies, then a module is designed to trigger the root cause localization. Specifically, the EAD method updates the parameters of base classifiers to dynamically adapt to different KPI data distributions. The ensemble of soft labels generated by base classifiers is subsequently fed into the secondary classifier to achieve information-lossless anomaly detection. Then, a heuristic module is proposed to select the most appropriate KPI data based on the metric i.e., bilayer relative difference to trigger the efficient root cause localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ATS is more than twice as fast as most state-of-the-art solutions while with higher troubleshooting accuracy. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","Bilayer Relative Difference; Ensemble Anomaly Detection; Soft Label; Troubleshooting","Benchmarking; Classification (of information); Anomaly detection; Base classifiers; Bi-layer; Bilayer relative difference; Ensemble anomaly detection; Key performance indicators; Localisation; Root cause; Soft labels; Troubleshooting systems; Anomaly detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200738493"

The decision for routing is made based on a weighted heuristic. The proposed algorithm, QLEN aims to improve three quality of service factors, namely L (load balancing efficiency), E (energy consumption) and N (network usage); hence the name QLEN. The importance of these parameters can be varied according to the application. This is done by adjusting the weights to suit the needs of the incoming tasks. For the default use case, the weights are tuned for the optimization of all three of the parameters. These optimal weights are calculated using stochastic gradient descent. QLEN is compared against fundamental load balancing algorithms such as Round Robin, Throttled Round Robin and Priority Based Load Balancing algorithm. The environment simulates a health monitoring application, using the iFogSim simulator. The results show that QLEN consistently outperforms the compared algorithms with respect to the targeted parameters.

As a result, functions processing network packets have become responsible for a rapidly increasing portion of the datacenter tax. To tackle this problem, the industry has developed SmartNICs (SNICs) integrating conventional NICs with inexpensive and energy-efficient processors that can efficiently execute functions widely used by network-intensive datacenter applications. With such processors, the SNICs promise to reduce the total cost of ownership (TCO) for datacenters by increasing energy efficiency of servers and/or decreasing the number of expensive server CPU cores. In this paper, to make sense of using SNICs, we focus on analyzing energy efficiency of a server with an SNIC, especially under service level objective (SLO) constraints which matter for many datacenter applications. To this end, we not only measure the system-wide power consumption of a server but also devise a custom hardware setup that allows us to isolate the power consumption of the SNIC from that of the server. This helps us better understand the impact of using SNICs on energy efficiency of servers. Second, we take popular TCP/UDP, DPDK, and RDMA-based functions, and prepare them to run on an SNIC processor and a server CPU. Then, we measure maximum throughput, tail latency, system-wide energy efficiency of executing the functions on the SNIC processor and the server CPU, respectively. Lastly, based on analyses of the measurements, we make five key observations and three strategies to better use and design SmartNICs in the future.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Electric power utilization; Green computing; Program processors; CPU cores; Custom hardwares; Datacenter; Energy efficient; Network packets; Performance; Processing Network; Scalings; Service level objective; Total cost of ownership; Energy efficiency","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177597744"

However, the GCN assumes every sensor's importance to be the same and describes the spatial correlation purely from a data perspective. To resolve the two issues that affect prediction accuracy, this study proposes a weighting strategy and develops a spatial correlation-based GCN (SCGCN) prediction model. Self-attention mechanism is used to comprehensively analyze water demand data of every sensor and flow resistance between sensors (i.e., head loss along pipes), generating spatial correlation coefficients with the consideration of hydraulics. Then the coefficients are used as weights to aggregate neighboring sensors’ data, extracting accurate input features for the SCGCN model. The study utilized real monitoring data to develop the SCGCN model and compare it with a traditional artificial neural network (ANN) model. Results show that the SCGCN model can outperform the ANN model, especially for multi-step prediction.

The centralized and traditional architecture of cloud computing does not meet the demands of users and proper implementation of latency-sensitive applications due to latency and mass demands of IoT applications that have different needs compared to existing applications. As a result, edge computing has been presented for collecting and processing of data generated by these objects, which facilitates data processing with low latency and close to users at the edge of the network. Its main purpose is to bring computational resources and storage close to the end-user on the network. As far as the storage capacity of fog nodes is limited, the proper use of fog node resources significantly influences their performance. In this paper, a framework based on control MAPE-K loop has been used to obtain the optimal state in workload balance. The users’ workload forecasting model is a combination of linear regression and support vector regression methods and offers better performance compared to the conventional reactive self-assessment methods. In the planning phase, a fuzzy self-learning algorithm is used to determine the automated scale of resource provisioning policy.

Viewing smart cities as urban surveillance platforms, there arises a pressing need for efficient analysis and storage of video streams from numerous cameras scattered across the city, owned by various stakeholders. However, surveillance systems face several internet of things (IoT) challenges, including privacy concerns, scalability issues, and substantial energy consumption. To tackle these challenges, the development of a trusted video surveillance system by integrating the internet of spatial things (IoST) with fog computing and blockchain technology was introduced. Fog nodes are strategically deployed at the network's edge, enabling the extension of cloud services closer to the data source. This deployment strategy aims to reduce latency and alleviate network congestion. At these fog nodes, the system employs a proof-of-work-based consensus algorithm, encrypted using the secure hash algorithm (SHA-256), to ensure data trust and reliability within the blockchain infrastructure supporting the surveillance system. The evaluation of our proposed blockchain-IoST surveillance system involves a comparison of two case studies: one based on fog computing and the other on traditional cloud-based blockchain-IoST implementations, conducted within the iFogSim framework. Furthermore, the system's scalability is tested under various scenarios. To assess the effectiveness of our methodology in mitigating latency, optimizing network utilization, and reducing energy consumption, we conducted comprehensive simulations. The results of our experiments clearly demonstrate the advantages of the fog-based blockchain-IoST approach. This approach significantly reduces latency and network utilization when compared to the conventional cloud-based blockchain-IoST implementation in the trusted video surveillance system. Additionally, the findings indicate that adopting the fog-based blockchain-IoST approach leads to a noteworthy reduction in energy consumption compared to the cloud-based implementation, further enhancing the sustainability and efficiency of the surveillance system. © 2023 Noor Alsaedi and Ali Sadeq Abdulhadi Jalal.","Cloud based blockchain-IoST; Fog based blockchain-IoST; Internet of spatial things; Spatial blockchain; Video surveillance system","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173894086"

Considering the prediction-uncertainty of forthcoming requests, certain IoT services may (i) not be hosted currently by appropriate IoT devices, or (ii) such an IoT service exists, but its non-functional properties may hardly be satisfied with respect to certain constraints prescribed by requests. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an efficiency-aware service Migration Scheduling (denoted eMS) mechanism in edge networks, in order to migrate IoT services on-demand, and thus, to optimally settle non-satisfiable constraints. Specifically, IoT services are re-scheduled, such that certain IoT services are migrated from their hosting IoT devices to neighboring ones, while minimizing the energy consumption and average delay caused by this service re-scheduling operation. We formulate this service re-scheduling as a multi-objective and multi-constraint optimization problem, which is solved through integrating the greedy algorithm into the fast non-dominated sorting and crowded-comparison operators as the hybrid genetic algorithm (G-NSGA-II). Based on real-life datasets provided by an oil pipeline monitoring project, extensive experiments are conducted, and evaluation results show that our eMS is promising in reducing the energy consumption and average delay of service re-scheduling in comparison with the state-of-art's techniques.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","data and/or computation-intensive services; edge networks; IoT service re-scheduling; service migration","Constrained optimization; Genetic algorithms; Internet of things; Job analysis; Computation intensives; Data and/or computation-intensive service; Data computation; Delay; EDGE Networks; Energy-consumption; Internet of thing service re-scheduling; Performances evaluation; Processor scheduling; Re-scheduling; Service migration; Task analysis; Energy utilization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148427364"

Therefore, edge computing, which brings network functions close to end-users by providing caching, computing and communication resources at network edges, turns into a promising paradigm. Benefit from its nature, edge computing enables emerging scenarios and use cases, such as augmented reality (AR) and Internet of Things (IowT). However, it also creates complexities to efficiently orchestrate heterogeneous services and manage distributed resources in the edge network. In this survey, we make a comprehensive review of the research efforts on service orchestration and resource management for edge computing. We first give an overview of edge computing, including architectures, advantages, enabling technologies and standardization. Next, a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art techniques in the management and orchestration of edge computing is presented. Subsequently, the state-of-the-art research on the infrastructure of edge computing is discussed in various aspects.

Age of Information (AoI), which is a metric to evaluate the freshness of status information in data processing, has become one of the most important objectives in IIoT. In this paper, considering limited communication, computation and energy resources on IoT devices, we jointly study the optimal AoI-aware energy control and computation offloading problem within a dynamic IIoT scenario with multiple IoT devices and multiple edge servers. Based on extensive analysis of real-life IoT dataset, Markovian queueing models are constructed to capture the dynamics of IoT devices and edge servers, and their corresponding analyses are provided. With the quantitative analytical results, we formulate a dynamic Markov decision problem with the objective of minimizing the long-term energy consumption while satisfying AoI constraints for real-time data processing. To solve the problem, we apply Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques for adapting to large-scale dynamic IIoT environments, and design an intelligent Energy Control and Computation Offloading (ECCO) algorithm.

A key challenge in such systems is the deployment of latency-critical and AI based resource-intensive applications in constrained devices. To address this challenge, we propose a novel memory-efficient deep learning based model, namely generative optimization networks (GON). Unlike GANs, GONs use a single network to both discriminate input and generate samples, significantly reducing their memory footprint. Leveraging the low memory footprint of GONs, we propose a decentralized fault-tolerance method called DRAGON that runs simulations (as per a digital modeling twin) to quickly predict and optimize the performance of the edge federation. Extensive experiments with real-world edge computing benchmarks on multiple Raspberry-Pi based federated edge configurations show that DRAGON can outperform the baseline methods in fault-detection and Quality of Service (QoS) metrics. Specifically, the proposed method gives higher F1 scores for fault-detection than the best deep learning (DL) method, while consuming lower memory than the heuristic methods. This allows for improvement in energy consumption, response time and service level agreement violations by up to 74, 63 and 82 percent, respectively.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","decentralized management; Edge computing; fault-tolerance; federated computing; generative optimization networks","Benchmarking; Deep learning; Edge detection; Energy utilization; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Fault tolerance; Heuristic methods; Job analysis; Optimization; Quality of service; Cloud-computing; Computational modelling; Decentralized management; Deep learning; Edge computing; Fault- tolerant systems; Federated computing; Generative optimization network; Image edge detection; Optimisations; Task analysis; Edge computing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136702724"

Previous work suggested the use of controllers based on control theory or machine learning to reduce performance degradation under constrained power. However, generating these controllers is challenging as every web service applications running in a data center requires a power-performance model and a fine-tuned controller. In this paper, we present DDPC, a system for autonomic data-driven controller generation for power-latency management. DDPC automates the process of designing and deploying controllers for dynamic power allocation to manage the power-performance trade-offs for latency-sensitive web applications such as a social network. For each application, DDPC uses system identification techniques to learn an adaptive power-performance model that captures the application's power-latency trade-offs which is then used to generate and deploy a Proportional-Integral (PI) power controller with gain-scheduling to dynamically manage the power allocation to the server running application using RAPL. We evaluate DDPC with two realistic latency-sensitive web applications under varying load scenarios. Our results show that DDPC is capable of autonomically generating and deploying controllers within a few minutes reducing the active power allocation of a web-server by more than 50% compared to state-of-the-art techniques while maintaining the latency well below the target of the application. © 2023 ACM.","datacenter; power-management; Web service performance","Adaptive control systems; Commerce; Controllers; Design; Economic and social effects; Electric loads; Information management; Power management; Two term control systems; Websites; Data driven; Datacenter; Performance Modeling; Power; Power performance; Service performance; WEB application; Web applications; Web service performance; Webs services; Web services","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159298066"

Such datasets consist of numerical and string variables, with a high variety of values.

Data analysis and pre-processing are usually more substantial and time-consuming than the implementation of the machine algorithms. Nevertheless, the obtained results are significantly influenced by the way missing data or outliers are approached. This paper presents various methods for coping with null and extreme values. Furthermore, it highlights the significance of encoding and scaling the analysed data and their impact on the performance of the machine learning algorithms.

Since being introduced by Beck and Fowler, the term code smell has attracted several studies from researchers and practitioners. However, over time, studies are needed to discuss whether this issue is still interesting and relevant. Objective: Conduct a thorough systematic literature review to learn the most recent state of the art for studying code smells, including detection methods, practices, and challenges. Also, an overview of trends and future relevance of the topic of code smell, whether it is still developing, or if there has been a shift in the discussion. Method: The search methodology was employed to identify pertinent scholarly articles from reputable databases such as ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, SpringerLink, ProQuest, and CiteSeerX. The application of inclusion and exclusion criteria serves to filter the search results. In addition, forward and backward snowballing techniques are employed to enhance the comprehensiveness of the results. Results: The inquiry yielded 354 scholarly articles published over the timeframe spanning from January 2013 to July 2022. After inclusion, exclusion, and snowballing techniques were applied, 69 main studies regarding code smells were identified. Many researchers focus on detecting code smells, primarily via machine learning techniques and, to a lesser extent, deep learning methods. Additional subjects encompass the ramifications of code smells; code smells within specific contexts, the correlation between code smells and software metrics, and facets about security, refactoring, and development habits. Contexts and types of code smells vary in the focus of the study. Some tools used are Jspirit, aDoctor, CAME, and SonarQube. The study also explores the concept of design smells and anti-pattern detection. While a singular dominating technique to code smell detection has yet to be thoroughly investigated, other aspects of code smell detection remain that still need to be examined. Conclusion: The findings underscore scholarly attention's evolution towards code smells over the years. This study identified significant journals and conferences and influential researchers in this field. The detection methods used include empirical, machine learning, and deep learning. However, challenges include subjective interpretation and limited contextual applicability.  © 2023 The Authors.","bad smell; Code smell; detection; software quality; systematic review","Codes (symbols); Computer software selection and evaluation; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Odors; Pattern recognition; Bad smells; Code smell; Design implementation; Detection; Detection methods; Research trends; Scholarly articles; Software Quality; Systematic Review; Trend detection; Digital libraries","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178069199"

In addition, the accuracy of demand prediction significantly impacts supply chain management. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a powerful method that learns intricate patterns through vast amounts of historical data and provides a prediction, demonstrating excellent performance in demand prediction. However, standard RNN-based demand predictions are limited by many outliers that occur due to the characteristics of the paint industry. Unexpected events such as a factory fire cause rapid fluctuations in paint demand and are difficult to pre-observe. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach that employs clustering to identify demand time series data with similar characteristics and applies statistical outlier adjustment to allow the prediction model to learn the complex patterns of actual demand. The prediction target is the sum of sales for 15 days in the future, and sales data for four paint products are used to evaluate the proposed approach. Experimental results demonstrate a satisfactory prediction accuracy improvement ranging from 100.9% to 152.4%. In addition, unlike the RNN-based models used for comparison, the proposed method is more robust against actual demand fluctuations.  © 2023 The Authors.","clustering; Demand prediction; outlier; paint industry; recurrent neural network","Forecasting; Paint; Recurrent neural networks; Statistics; Time series analysis; Clusterings; Demand prediction; Learn+; Modeling approach; Network-based modeling; Outlier; Paint industry; Predictive models; Statistical approach; Time-series analysis; Supply chain management","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177067389"

However, monitoring data are not available to many potential users and the disparate nature of water bodies makes consistent monitoring across so many systems difficult. While satellite Earth observation (EO) offers solutions, there are numerous challenges that limit the use of satellite EO for water monitoring. To understand the perceptions of using satellite EO for water quality monitoring, a survey was conducted within academia and the water quality management sector. Study objectives were to assess community understanding of satellite EO water quality data, identify barriers in the adoption of satellite EO data, and analyse trust in satellite EO data.

However, the need for frequent updates in game development may lead to quick-fix solutions and bad coding practices. Though unintentional, these bad practices may lead to poor program comprehension and can cause several issues during software maintenance. The quick-fix solutions might lead to technical debts due to the presence of anti-patterns and code smells, which may affect the functional and non-functional requirements of the game. To avoid such instances, game developers may need some guidelines to refer to during the game development process. Thus, to aid developers and researchers, in our previous work, we had presented an initial catalogue of anti-patterns in the domain of game development. To broaden the scope of the catalogue and diversify the instances of anti-patterns, we analyzed additional data from a Q&A platform. We present 15 game-specific anti-patterns based on thematic analysis of 189 issues, 892 commits, 104 pull requests from 100 open-source GitHub game repositories, and 971 questions from Game Development Stack Exchange. We see the catalogue as an effort towards improving the development and quality of the games.

However, utilizing a dense deployment of sensors generates a significant volume of data that must be transmitted to the cloud, requiring high bandwidth and consuming substantial power, particularly when using wireless protocols. To optimize the energy budget of the monitoring system, it is crucial to reduce the size of the raw data near the sensors at the edge. However, existing compression techniques at the edge suffer from a tradeoff between compression and accuracy and long latency resulting in high energy consumption. This letter addresses these limitations by introducing a parallelized version of an unconventional data reduction method suited for vibration analysis based on system identification models. Our approach leverages the unique capabilities of GAP9, a multicore RISC-V MCU based on the parallel ultra-low-power (PULP) architecture.

However, the performance of existing models is not satisfactory, which limits its further application. The poor performance mainly results from the lack of data mining of economic models and the poor stability of most data analysis models. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a new dynamic model ensemble transformer (DMEformer). The model uses three different Transformer variants as base models. It not only ensures the difference of base models but also makes the prediction results of base models not to appear disparity. In addition, NSGA-II is adopted to ensemble the results of base models, which considers both the modeling stability and accuracy in the optimization. Finally, the proposed model adopts a dynamic ensemble scheme, which could timely adjust the weight vector according to the fluctuation of energy futures. It further improves the reliability of the model. Comparative experiments from the perspective of single models and ensemble models are also designed. The following conclusions can be drawn from the experimental results: (1) The proposed dynamic ensemble method can improve the performance of the base model and traditional static ensemble method by 16% and 5% respectively. (2) DMEformer can achieve better performance than 20 other models, and its accuracy and MAPE values were 72.5% and 2.8043%, respectively.

Usually, the scheduling algorithm considers only a limited sample of the infrastructure nodes, typically obtained through random sampling. The sampling reduces the number of nodes, which need to be evaluated in the scheduling pipeline, making the scheduling process more saleable. Unfortunately, current sampling approaches become largely inefficient when the infrastructure is heterogeneous and specific, scarce node characteristics are required to successfully execute a workload. Computing continuum infrastructures are heterogeneous, hence, we need to re-think the sampling process to keep it viable at scale while also being able to identify and leverage the heterogeneity of the Edge-Cloud continuum resources. In this article, we present Intelligent Sampling - a novel technique for improving sampling in large-scale and heterogeneous infrastructures. We develop a model for any heterogeneous infrastructure. Based on this model, we provide a method to sample the infrastructure nodes more accurately, considering the specific task at hand. Finally, we leverage the Alibaba PAI dataset to show that our approach is 2.5x times more accurate compared with other state-of-the-art sampling mechanisms while retaining comparable performance and scalability.  © 2023 IEEE.","Computing continuum; Heterogeneous infrastructure model; Intelligent sampling; Workloads scheduling","Polyamideimides; Computing continuum; Edge clouds; Heterogeneous computing; Heterogeneous infrastructure model; Infrastructure modeling; Intelligent samplings; Large scale infrastructures; Large-scales; Random sampling; Workload scheduling; Scheduling algorithms","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174923122"

This method takes advantage of AI's capabilities to extract information from large samples of data and of human critical thinking to find patterns in those data. Specifically, the method is used to evaluate the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies, analyse how they are deployed worldwide, and investigate their sustainability outcomes. In terms of overall frequency, robots and cybersecurity are the most often reported technologies. Broken down by the firm's region, Asian firms have the highest rate of adoption, while African firms are lagging. Regarding the themes, Industry 4.0 is mainly adopted to improve production processes and customer experience. A small percentage of firms, particularly in Europe and North America, utilize Industry 4.0 to reduce the environmental footprint of their operations. Furthermore, results indicate that Industry 4.0 and sustainability are following two routes. Some firms have massively adopted Industry 4.0 to increase operational efficiency and reaped environmental gains as an indirect consequence of improved operations. Others have chosen to balance the adoption of technologies aimed to increase productivity with innovations whose explicit aim is the reduction of their operations' environmental footprint, such as additive manufacturing. Eastern firms tend to follow the first route while western firms the second. African and South American firms are still at a very early stage in their Industry 4.0 and sustainability journey.

However, the considerable number of evaluations of popular optimisation methods based on metaheuristics cause significant delays for real-time pump scheduling, and the simplification of traditional deterministic methods may introduce bias towards the optimal solutions. To address these limitations, an exploration-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework is proposed to address real-time pump scheduling problems in water distribution systems. The experimental results indicate that E-PPO can learn suboptimal scheduling policies for various demand distributions and can control the application time to 0.42 s by transferring the online computation-intensive optimisation task offline. Furthermore, a form of penalty of the tank level was found that can reduce energy costs by up to 11.14% without sacrificing the water level in the long term. Following the DRL framework, the proposed method makes it possible to schedule pumps in a more agile way as a timely response to changing water demand while still controlling the energy cost and level of tanks. © 2023 by the authors.","deep reinforcement learning; exploration enhancement; PPO; real-time pump scheduling; water distribution network","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149261086"

So the service coverages of current edge servers may exceed the mobile user’s location, which prevents the user from getting the service they need. For some low latency services, such as video optimized transmission and Internet of vehicles, it is necessary to maintain business continuity by timely selecting services provided by appropriate edge servers during the rapid movement of users. Therefore, this paper proposes a user location-aware edge services selection method based on generative adversarial network (GAN) and improved ant colony algorithm. Using this method to select edge services can provide users with uninterrupted services and improve service quality and user satisfaction. Firstly, a mobile user location prediction method based on the generative adversarial network and the attention mechanism is proposed. This method adopts graph attention network (GAT) and recurrent neural network (RNN) to model user in space and time dimensions, and uses GAN to predict the user’s next moment location, according to which, the edge services meeting user’s needs can be selected in advance. Then, an edge services selection method based on the predicted user location and improved ant colony algorithm is proposed. This method adopts ant colony algorithm with improved pheromone updating rules and single-cycle optimal list to select edge services, which enhances the global search ability of ants, accelerates the convergence speed of the algorithm and avoids the algorithm falling into a local optimal solution. Experimental results show that the proposed user location prediction method is more reasonable and accurate in predicting user location. The proposed edge service selection method has obvious advantages in aspects of algorithm convergence speed, accuracy and service response time. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Ant Colony algorithm; Edge service selection; Generative adversarial network; Graph attention network; User location-aware","Ant colony optimization; Forecasting; Generative adversarial networks; Recurrent neural networks; Vehicle transmissions; Ant colonies algorithm; Edge service selection; Edge services; Graph attention network; Improved ant colony algorithm; Location-aware; Mobile users; Service selection; User location; User location-aware; Location","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140229339"

Based on the simulation result, the EA algorithm is superior to the greedy resource allocation in time delay, energy consumption, quality of service (QoS) especially with limited computing resources. © 2023, THE JOURNAL OF CHINA UNIVERSITIES OF POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS.","cloud-edge collaboration; computing first networking (CFN); computing resource allocation; multi-objective optimization (MOO)","Edge computing; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Green computing; Multiobjective optimization; Quality of service; Regression analysis; Cloud-edge collaboration; Computing first networking; Computing resource; Computing resource allocation; Edge computing; Edge networkings; Energy-consumption; Multi-objective optimization; Multi-objectives optimization; Resources allocation; Resource allocation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143546832"

However, long-term QPS prediction is challenging in two aspects: 1) generality across various services with different temporal patterns, 2) characterization of intricate QPS sequences which are entangled by multiple components. In this paper, we propose a knowledge auto-embedding Informer network (KAE-Informer) for forecasting the long-term QPS sequences of microservices. By analyzing a large number of microservice traces, we discover that there are two main decomposable and predictable components in QPS sequences, namely global trend & dominant periodicity (TP) and low-frequency residual patterns with long-range dependencies. These two components are important for accurately forecasting long-term QPS. First, KAE-Informer embeds the knowledge of TP components through mathematical modeling. Second, KAE-Informer designs a convolution ProbSparse self-attention mechanism and a multi-layer event discrimination scheme to extract and embed the knowledge of local context awareness and event regression effect implied in residual components, respectively. We conduct experiments based on three real datasets including a QPS dataset collected from 40 microservices. The experiment results show that KAE-Informer achieves a reduction of MAPE, MAE and RMSE by about 16.6%, 17.6% and 23.1% respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art models. © 2023 ACM.","forecasting; microservices; neural network; time-series analysis; workload","Embeddings; Time series analysis; Embeddings; Global trends; Lower frequencies; Microservice; Multiple components; Neural-networks; Resources allocation; Temporal pattern; Time-series analysis; Workload; Forecasting","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159265082"

To take advantage of this opportunity for humans and the environment, the transformation process must be understood as a design process that affects almost all areas of life. In this paper, we investigate AI-Based Self-Adaptive Cyber-Physical Process Systems (AI-CPPS) as an extension of the traditional CPS view. As contribution, we present a framework that addresses challenges that arise from recent literature. The aim of the AI-CPPS framework is to enable an adaptive integration of IoT environments with higher-level process-oriented systems. In addition, the framework integrates humans as actors into the system, which is often neglected by recent related approaches. The framework consists of three layers, i.e., processes, semantic modeling, and systems and actors, and we describe for each layer challenges and solution outlines for application. We also address the requirement to enable the integration of new networked devices under the premise of a targeted process that is optimally designed for humans, while profitably integrating AI and IoT. It is expected that AI-CPPS can contribute significantly to increasing sustainability and quality of life and offer solutions to pressing problems such as environmental protection, mobility, or demographic change. Thus, it is all the more important that the systems themselves do not become a driver of resource consumption.  © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.","artificial intelligence; business process management; cyber-physical-systems; framework; Green AI; process-aware information system","Embedded systems; Enterprise resource management; Information management; Internet of things; Semantics; Sustainable development; Business Process; Business process management; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber physicals; Cyber-physical systems; Framework; Green AI; Physical process; Process management; Process-aware information systems; Cyber Physical System","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162805612"

The aim of this article is to perform an in-depth analysis of the driving performance of professional drivers during their working day, taking into account the influence of fleet management decisions. For this, we have selected four urban public transport companies with clear differences in terms of the employees scheduled and rostered drivers to bus lines.

Therefore, high quality of service (QoS) routing is essential to the secure and robust operation of the WISNs. Specifically, the QoS routing optimization in WISN is a nondeterministic polynomial hard problem, which usually cannot be solved by ordinary algorithms. Based on this motivation, a novel heuristic trust scheme (i.e., multi-objective trust routing scheme based on cloned elite slime mould algorithm (CESMA-MTRS)) is proposed to greatly improve the security and QoS of WISN. The scheme designs a novel trust difference test mechanism to enhance the identification of malicious nodes. Furthermore, a new elite archiving strategy and clone optimization strategy are designed to improve the convergence speed of grid monitoring data transmission routing search. The simulation results show that when the network scale is 100 and the attacked node scale is 30%, CESMA-MTRS reduces the delay by 8% and 15% and the packet loss rate by 24% and 27%, respectively, compared with trust-based routing protocol called the On-demand trust-based multicast routing protocol (ODTMRP) and evolutionary selfcooperative trust approach. © 2007-2012 IEEE.","Power grid monitoring; quality of service; slime mold algorithm; trust mechanism; wireless image sensor network","Ant colony optimization; Electric power transmission networks; Grid computing; Internet protocols; Monitoring; Peer to peer networks; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Delay; Grid monitoring; Image sensor networks; Peer-to-peer computing; Power grid monitoring; Power grids; Quality-of-service; Routing-protocol; Routings; Slime mold algorithm; Slime moulds; Trust mechanism; Wireless image sensor network; Quality of service","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135756210"

This paper presents the design, execution and results of a systematic mapping study of architectural tactics in software architecture literature. The study found 552 studies in well-known digital libraries, of which 79 were selected and 12 more were added with snowballing, giving a total of 91 primary studies.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) procedures are highly recommended as they provide crucial cardiology information. Telemedicine offers an opportunity to provide low-cost tools and widespread availability for CVD management. In this research, we proposed an IoT-based monitoring and detection system for cardiac patients, employing a two-stage approach. In the initial stage, we used a routing protocol that combines routing by energy and link quality (REL) with dynamic source routing (DSR) to efficiently collect data on an IoT healthcare platform. The second stage involves the classification of ECG images using hybrid-based deep features. Our classification system utilizes the “ECG Images dataset of Cardiac Patients”, comprising 12-lead ECG images with four distinct categories: abnormal heartbeat, myocardial infarction (MI), previous history of MI, and normal ECG. For feature extraction, we employed a lightweight CNN, which automatically extracts relevant ECG features. These features were further optimized through an attention module, which is the method’s main focus. The model achieved a remarkable accuracy of 98.39%. Our findings suggest that this system can effectively aid in the identification of cardiac disorders. The proposed approach combines IoT, deep learning, and efficient routing protocols, showcasing its potential for improving CVD diagnosis and management. © 2023 by the authors.","cardiovascular diseases (CVDs); CNN; deep learning; ECG; IoT","Electrocardiography; Heart Diseases; Heart Rate; Humans; Myocardial Infarction; Telemedicine; Cardiology; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Diseases; Heart; Image classification; Internet of things; Cardiac disorders; Cardiac patients; Cardiovascular disease; Deep learning; Disease management; IoT; Low cost tools; Myocardial Infarction; Routing-protocol; electrocardiography; heart disease; heart infarction; heart rate; human; telemedicine; Electrocardiograms","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172722809"

Existing task offloading approaches, focusing on perfecting the balance between latency and energy consumption, completely ignore the impacts of the user preference caused by low battery anxiety. The existence of low battery anxiety - mobile users’ common fear of losing battery energy, especially when the battery energy is already low - causes users to trade high latency for prolonged battery life. Taking into account the user preference impacts on task offloading, we propose a novel offloading approach called UPOA to obtain refined offloading policies between low latency and energy consumption based on user preferences. In UPOA, we start the study by defining a user preference rule that determines users’ offloading preferences according to battery energy status. Then, we build a fine-grained task offloading model to delineate the task distribution characteristics of each node in its offloading link. Guided by this model, we develop a task prediction algorithm based on the long-short-term-memory neural network model to provide task predictions that facilitate offloading policies. Lastly, we implement a particle-swarm-optimization-based online offloading algorithm. The offloading algorithm provides the best long-term offloading policies by incorporating the user preference determined by our user preference rule and the task predictions generated by our task prediction algorithm. To quantitatively evaluate the performance of UPOA, we conduct extensive experiments in a real-world cloud-edge environment. We compare UPOA with three state-of-the-art offloading approaches, DRA, DRL-E2D, and MUDRL under various conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that UPOA can make effective policies based on user preferences compared with the existing approaches. UPOA reduces average latency by 12.49% when battery energy is sufficient and extends battery life by 20.14% when battery energy is low. © 2022 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; Cloud-edge system; low battery anxiety; task offloading; user preference","computation offloading; Electric batteries; Forecasting; Job analysis; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power management; Anxiety disorder; Battery; Cloud-edge system; Computational modelling; Energy-consumption; Low battery anxiety; Low-latency communication; Prediction algorithms; Task analysis; Task offloading; User's preferences; Energy utilization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135760535"

While many new technologies based on Machine Learning (ML) have enabled systems to be utilized for a diverse set of applications, such as license plate detection and car YMM (Year, Make Model) classification, one of the underlying concerns behind VSSs for both public and private sectors is the cost and resource constraints of the devices themselves. Given that optical character recognition and object detection are already computing and data-intensive activities, both in regards to the training of those ML models, as well as the real-time processing of the data, it is highly desired to create or optimize systems to operate on lightweight Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight scheme for Decentralized Vehicular Identification (DEVID), which is affordable to inexpensive IoT devices as long as they are capable of managing their inputs and outputs (IO) in a fashion that is not costly in terms of storage or power consumption. While the performance in the experimental study is not satisfactory, the DEVID system possesses the potential to be a cost-friendly lightweight solution for smart cities.  © 2023 IEEE.","Internet of Things (IoT); Machine Learning (ML); Optical Character Recognition (OCR); Vehicle Tracking; Video Surveillance System (VSS)","Digital storage; Internet of things; License plates (automobile); Network security; Object detection; Object recognition; Optical character recognition; Real time systems; Security systems; Smart city; Decentralised; Edge nodes; Internet of thing; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Optical character recognition; Private sectors; Public safety; Video surveillance system; Video surveillance systems; Machine learning","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182394374"

The data center's communications network will also consume more energy due to the increased communication among the microservices of the SaaS. Due to the fact that microservice-based SaaS deployment is handled by the developer of the microservice-based SaaS and can only be deployed on virtual machines rented by the developer, this issue cannot be taken into account in traditional microservice-based SaaS deployment methods. In this paper, a new microservice-based SaaS deployment method is proposed. The new approach relies on the data center determining where microservices should be deployed. The new microservice-based SaaS deployment method considers the energy increase in the computation servers and in the communication network. The microservice-based SaaS deployment problem is a combinatorial optimization problem. Thus, a genetic algorithm with repairing mechanism is proposed to solve the problem.

Benefiting from edge and cloud computing, IoMT is provided with more computing and storage resources near the terminal to meet the low-delay requirements of computation-intensive services. However, the service offloading from health monitoring units (HMUs) to edge servers generates additional energy consumption. Fortunately, artificial intelligence (AI), which has developed rapidly in recent years, has proved effective in some resource allocation applications. Taking both energy consumption and delay into account, we propose an energy-aware service offloading algorithm under an end-edge-cloud collaborative IoMT system with Asynchronous Advantage Actor-critic (A3C), named ECAC. Technically, ECAC uses the structural similarity between the natural distributed IoMT system and A3C, whose parameters are asynchronously updated. Besides, due to the typical delay-sensitivity mechanism and time-energy correction, ECAC can adjust dynamically to the diverse service types and system requirements. Finally, the effectiveness of ECAC for IoMT is proved on real data.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.","asynchronous advantage actor-critic; deep reinforcement learning; internet of medical things; Service offloading","Computation offloading; Deep learning; Digital storage; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Green computing; Internet of things; Power management; Web services; Actor critic; Asynchronoi advantage actor-critic; Deep reinforcement learning; Energy  savings; Energy-consumption; Energy-savings; Internet of medical thing; Quality of health care; Reinforcement learnings; Service offloading; Reinforcement learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166311048"

However, challenges related to latency, privacy, and bandwidth have arisen due to the massive influx of data generated by IoT devices and the limitations of traditional cloud-based architectures. Moreover, network management, interoperability, security, and scalability issues have emerged due to the rapid growth and heterogeneous nature of IoT devices. To overcome such problems, researchers proposed a new architecture called Software Defined Networking for Edge Computing in the Internet of Things (SDN-EC-IoT), which combines Edge Computing for the Internet of Things (EC-IoT) and Software Defined Internet of Things (SDIoT). Although researchers have studied EC-IoT and SDIoT as individual architectures, they have not yet addressed the combination of both, creating a significant gap in our understanding of SDN-EC-IoT. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive review of how the SDN-EC-IoT paradigm can solve IoT challenges. To achieve this goal, this study conducted a literature review covering 74 articles published between 2019 and 2023. Finally, this paper identifies future research directions for SDN-EC-IoT, including the development of interoperability platforms, scalable architectures, low latency and Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees, efficient handling of big data, enhanced security and privacy, optimized energy consumption, resource-aware task offloading, and incorporation of machine learning. © 2023 College of Education, Al-Iraqia University.

However, limited tools are available to support the integration of human values during software development. Most of these tools are focused on concepts related to specific, well-known human values (e.g., privacy, security) in software engineering. This paper aims to (partially) address this gap by developing a human values dashboard. We conducted a multi-stage study to design, implement and evaluate a human values dashboard. First, an exploratory study was conducted by interviewing 15 software practitioners to investigate the possibility of using a human values dashboard to help address human values in software development, its potential benefits, and required features. Second, we experimented with four Machine Learning approaches to detect the presence of human values in issue discussions. We used the best approach to develop a human values dashboard for software development. The dashboard displays whether any human values are present in each issue discussion. Finally, we interviewed ten different practitioners to investigate the usefulness of the dashboard in practice. This study found that the human values dashboard could help raise awareness, focus attention, and prioritise issues based on the presence of values. This study also identified two potential challenges to the adoption of the dashboard. First, the possible incorrect issues description that can mislead the automated values identification in the dashboard. Second, the lack of willingness of a company to adopt the dashboard. © 2023, The Author(s).","Dashboard; GitHub; Human values; Issue discussion","Dashboard; Exploratory studies; Github; Human values; Issue discussion; Machine learning approaches; Multi-stages; Potential benefits; Software practitioners; Software-systems; Software design","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153287877"

While ensuring highly responsive low-latency CNF processing, the computing environments should conserve energy to reduce costs. In this systems integration study, we develop and evaluate the novel XDP-Monitoring Energy-Adaptive Network Functions (X-MAN) framework for managing the CPU operational states (P-states) so as to reduce the power consumption while prioritizing low-latency service. Architecturally, X-MAN consists of lightweight traffic monitors that are attached to the virtual network interfaces in the kernel space for per-CNF traffic monitoring and a power manager in user space with a global view of the CNFs on a CPU core. Algorithmically, X-MAN monitors the CPU core utilization via hybrid simple and weighted moving average prediction fed by the traffic monitors and a power management based on step-based CPU core frequency (P-state) adjustments. We evaluate X-MAN through extensive measurements in a real physical testbed operating at up to 10 Gbps. We find that X-MAN incurs significantly shorter and more consistent monitoring latencies for the CPU utilization than a state-of-the-art CPU hardware counter approach. Also, X-MAN achieves more responsive CPU core frequency adjustments and more pronounced reductions of the CPU power consumption than a state-of-the-art code instrumentation approach.

The Slicing Future Internet Infrastructures (SFI2) architecture proposal explores the gap resulting from the diversity of NS architectures target domains by proposing a new NS reference architecture with a defined focus on integrating experimental networks and enhancing the NS architecture with Machine Learning (ML) native optimizations, energy-efficient slicing, and slicing-tailored security functionalities. The SFI2 architectural main contribution includes the utilization of the slice-as-a-service paradigm for end-to-end orchestration of resources across multi-domains and multi-technology experimental networks. In addition, the SFI2 reference architecture instantiations will enhance the multi-domain and multi-technology integrated experimental network deployment with native ML optimization, energy-efficient aware slicing, and slicing-tailored security functionalities for the practical domain. © 2013 IEEE.","architectural slicing enhancements; energy-efficient slicing; experimental networks integration; ML-native optimization; Network slicing; network slicing architecture; slicing-tailored security","5G mobile communication systems; Artificial intelligence; Energy efficiency; Learning systems; Mobile cloud computing; Mobile edge computing; Network architecture; Architectural slicing enhancement; Energy efficient; Energy-efficient slicing; Experimental network integration; Machine learning-native optimization; Machine-learning; Network integration; Network slicing; Network slicing architecture; Optimisations; Slicing-tailored security; Network security","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164384259"

China is strengthening the construction of SIPs; however, the development of SIPs is limited. Due to different understandings of SIPs, the intelligence level of each SIP varies greatly. It is necessary to develop a SIP intelligence level assessment model to check these limitations. Most of the existing evaluations focus on the qualitative evaluation of the overall intelligence level of SIPs, ignoring the influence of each individual dimension. Therefore, this study used quantitative methods to measure the intelligence level of SIPs from the overall and dimensional levels. The evaluation method included five processes: (1) Classifying the intelligence level of SIPs through expert interviews; (2) Using the literature analysis method to identify various dimensions of the intelligence level; (3) Using literature analysis and expert interviews to determine the evaluation indicators (4) Weighting indicators based on correlation and induced ordered weighted average (IOWA) operator; (5) Using grey clustering analysis to calculate the overall intelligence performance of SIPs and each dimension. Finally, the developed model was verified by Z SIP. The analysis results show that the developed model can measure both overall and dimensional performance of SIPs, and demonstrated that enterprise information services, public information services, SIP security, and energy consumption monitoring platform construction make the greatest contributions to the improvement of the intelligence level. Our research results will help to improve the intelligence level of SIPs, and lay the foundation for the determination of the operating costs of SIPs and the formulation of national standards related to SIPs in the future. © 2022 by the authors.","grey clustering analysis; intelligence level; IOWA operator empowerment; smart industrial park","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140581073"

However, knowing a person’s medical history is a delicate and complex process, and accessing these digitized data is not always possible due to problems with network connectivity or physical communication with the person. In this work, we propose a solution for medical staff to obtain a patient’s medical history through facial recognition, and without the need for an internet connection. This proposal is based on the development of an architecture that allows connecting nearby mobile devices of doctors and patients without an internet connection to obtain the desired information using facial recognition as an authentication method. The architecture has been validated with the development of a mobile application that, by focusing on the patient’s face with the camera of the doctor’s mobile device, makes it possible to obtain the patient’s medical information.

The goal of this study is to come up with a way to improve steganography in ad hoc cloud systems by using deep learning. This research implementation is separated into two sections. In Phase 1, the “Ad-hoc Cloud System” idea and deployment plan were set up with the help of V-BOINC. In Phase 2, a modified form of steganography and deep learning were used to study the security of data transmission in ad-hoc cloud networks. In the majority of prior studies, attempts to employ deep learning models to augment or replace data-hiding systems did not achieve a high success rate. The implemented model inserts data images through colored images in the developed ad hoc cloud system. A systematic steganography model conceals from statistics lower message detection rates. Additionally, it may be necessary to incorporate small images beneath huge cover images.

The paper contributes to the existing literature by identifying the main aspects related to the dilution of once-added services by manufacturing firms. Research method: A literature review was conducted. A content analysis of the selected papers (89 publications) was carried out to identify the main challenges discussed in the servitization literature as issues leading to deservitization. Main findings: The explanations for manufacturing firms failing in the transition to servitization and consequently taking the deservitization path discussed in the literature are related to changes in the organizational structure, new capabilities, modification of the business model and strategy, and difficulties in the interaction between supplier and customer.

Specifically, the feature model is introduced to represent common and variable requirements and drive the variability design of service compositions. An abstract service composition model is used to define the variable business process.

With the decrease in environmental health, the environmental performance is decreasing continuously having adverse consequences for the societies. Therefore, to address the environmental problem in China, the current study examined the role of collaborative governance in environmental performance. Consequently, this study examined the relationship between collaborative governance, innovative methods, performance, availability of resources, environmental innovation resistance, environmental law, and environmental performance. Both the public and private companies of environmental protection working in China are considered. To address the objective of the study, a quantitative research approach is used along with the cross-sectional research design. A questionnaire survey is carried out among the public and private companies working in China for data collection. A total of 290 valid questionnaires were returned and used in data analysis. Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) is used for data analysis. Results of this study reported important findings which have a contribution to the literature and practice. Collaborative governance has major importance to enhance environmental performance. The collaboration between public and private companies has the potential to enhance environmental performance. It is found that an increase in collaborative governance can increase the innovative methods, performance, and availability of resources which can enhance environmental performance. The improvement in innovative methods, performance, and availability of resources can foster environmental performance. Furthermore, environmental innovation resistance can decrease environmental performance. Most significantly, environmental law is crucial to enhancing environmental performance. The better implementation of environmental law can enhance the environmental performance in China.

The importance of cloud data centers has expanded dramatically in the previous decade, and they are now regarded as the backbone of the modern economy. Cloud-based microservices architecture is incorporated by firms such as Netflix, Twitter, eBay, Amazon, Hailo, Groupon, and Zalando. Such cloud computing arrangements deal with the parallel deployment of data-intensive workloads in real time. Moreover, commonly utilized cloud services such as the web and email require continuous operation without interruption. For that purpose, cloud service providers must optimize resource management, efficient energy usage, and carbon footprint reduction. This study presents a conceptual framework to manage the high amount of microservice execution while reducing response time, energy consumption, and execution costs. The proposed framework suggests four key agent services: (1) intelligent partitioning: responsible for microservice classification; (2) dynamic allocation: used for pre-execution distribution of microservices among containers and then makes decisions for dynamic allocation of microservices at runtime; (3) resource optimization: in charge of shifting workloads and ensuring optimal resource use; (4) mutation ac-tions: these are based on procedures that will mutate the microservices based on cloud data center workloads. The suggested framework was partially evaluated using a custom-built simulation envi-ronment, which demonstrated its efficiency and potential for implementation in a cloud computing context. The findings show that the engrossment of suggested services can lead to a reduced number of network calls, lower energy consumption, and relatively reduced carbon dioxide emissions. © 2022 by the authors.

But, the privacy problems occur with a large amount of data produced and therefore the solutions on the basis of blockchain with sidechain technology have been developed to overcome these problems. Aim: Blockchain powered IoT networks have high security levels, and are resilient to most network attacks. In order to deploy blockchains, a large set of hashing, encryption, and linking algorithms are implemented in the network. One of the recent developments is the sidechains and these sidechains reduce computational complexity during block creation, and thereby reduce the effect of high delay and high-power consumption in the IoT network. But maintaining these sidechains requires an additional computational component, which adds to the computational complexity of the underlying system. To reduce the complexity of this maintenance while keeping the inherent advantages of side chaining networks, this article proposes a sidechain creation, updation, merging, and scanning processes. Methods: In this article, the sidechain creation is done by modified two-way peg protocol and updated by hybrid delegated practical byzantine fault tolerance-delegated proof of stake (DPBFT-DPOS), merging via continuous network information analysis and scanning via graph-based searching mechanism to improve the Quality of Service (QoS) network and security. Results: The proposed methodology achieves an accuracy and (Formula presented.) -score of about 98.6% and 99.5%, reduces end-to-end communication delay by 10% while increasing the energy efficiency by 15%, and improving the throughput by 15% when compared to other existing methods. Conclusion: The IoT provides the possibility of creating real time data and the combination of the IoT with blockchain moves beyond authorization and financial recording. Then the utilization of sidechain provide better communication among devices and better sophistication of the data processing. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","Blockchain; Complex networks; Computational complexity; Cryptography; Energy efficiency; Fault tolerance; Graphic methods; Machine learning; Merging; Network security; Quality of service; Block-chain; Hashing algorithms; High security levels; Large amounts of data; Network attack; New services; Privacy problems; Professional activities; Quality-of-service; Side-chains; Internet of things","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121580866"

Considering the successful transformation and upgrading of the manufacturing industry through servitization, scholars and practitioners have begun to explore the possibility of servitization in the construction industry. Current practices and theory show that different understandings of servitization in the construction sector exist; however, they are still in their infancy and lack a deep and systematic awareness, which does not benefit the transformation and upgrading of construction through servitization. Therefore, this paper systematically analyzes the motivation, definition, and implications of servitization in construction based on the value-adding nature of servitization and considers the problems confronting the construction industry. To facilitate this development, transformation pathways for servitization in construction are analyzed from multiple angles, including value co-creation, service innovation, and networked operation, which are in line with the new trends in digital construction. In addition, based on the supporting elements of construction, which include finance, human resources, technology, materials, and equipment, this paper examines the impact of servitization on the construction industry's ecology. In short, we expect that this systematic analysis and exposition can provide a holistic view of servitization in construction from the inside out for scholars and practitioners and can help to promote servitization in construction. © 2021 THE AUTHORS","Platform sharing; Service innovation; Servitization in construction; Value-adding","Construction equipment; 'current; Industrial transformations; Industrial upgrading; Manufacturing industries; Platform sharing; Service innovation; Servitization; Servitization in construction; Transformation pathways; Value-adding; Construction industry","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132952558"

However, even though several cloud-native tools and patterns have emerged to support scalability, there is no commonly accepted method to empirically benchmark their scalability. In this study, we present a benchmarking method, allowing researchers and practitioners to conduct empirical scalability evaluations of cloud-native applications, frameworks, and deployment options. Our benchmarking method consists of scalability metrics, measurement methods, and an architecture for a scalability benchmarking tool, particularly suited for cloud-native applications. Following fundamental scalability definitions and established benchmarking best practices, we propose to quantify scalability by performing isolated experiments for different load and resource combinations, which asses whether specified service level objectives (SLOs) are achieved. To balance usability and reproducibility, our benchmarking method provides configuration options, controlling the trade-off between overall execution time and statistical grounding. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation of our method’s configuration options for the special case of event-driven microservices. For this purpose, we use benchmark implementations of the two stream processing frameworks Kafka Streams and Flink and run our experiments in two public clouds and one private cloud. We find that, independent of the cloud platform, it only takes a few repetitions (≤ 5) and short execution times (≤ 5 minutes) to assess whether SLOs are achieved. Combined with our findings from evaluating different search strategies, we conclude that our method allows to benchmark scalability in reasonable time. © 2022, The Author(s).","Benchmarking; Cloud-Native; Performance engineering; Scalability","Application programs; Economic and social effects; Scalability; Application deployment; Application frameworks; Benchmarking methods; Cloud-native; Configuration options; Large-scale software systems; Performance engineering; Recent trends; Scalability evaluation; Service level objective; Benchmarking","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135556720"

The deterministic geometric topology and the randomness of the communication behaviors of 6G networks limit the realism and transparency of cross-platform and cross-object communication, twin, and computing co-simulation networks. Meanwhile, the parallel-based serverless architecture has a high redundancy of computational resource allocation. Therefore, for the first time, we present a new hypergraph hierarchical nested kriging model, which provides theoretical analysis and modeling of integrated relationships for communication, twin, and computing. We explore the hierarchical unified characterization method which joins heterogeneous topologies. A basis function matrix for local flexible connectivity of the global network is designed for the connection of huge heterogeneous systems to decouple the resource mapping among heterogeneous networks. To improve the efficiency of resource allocation in communication, twin, and computing integrated network, a multi-constraint multi-objective genetic algorithm (MMGA) based on the common requirements of operations, storage, interaction, and multi-layer optimal solution conflict is proposed for the first time.

However, the imperfect system resource isolation features and the kernel-sharing mechanism will introduce significant security risks to the cloud platform. In this paper, we present DockerWatch, a real-time detection system for malware detection in the container-based cloud platform. DockerWatch uses a non-intrusive manner to extract executable files inside the containers, then uses the ensemble of various static features and behavior-based graphs as the analysis vector to learn the robust representations of malicious patterns. Consequently, a two-phase hybrid detection method based on deep learning is proposed to accelerate and enhance the detection performance, aiming to address the trade-off between fast and high-performance real-time detection. Extensive experiments are conducted and compared with extensive existing related methods using real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of our system.

Load recognition allows HEMS to map all appliances, assisting in efficient management. In this regard, methods that solve the load recognition problem are vital for HEMS. The motivation of this work is to propose a novel system that enhances load recognition in HEMS applications.

Most IoT applications are very sensitive to delays, and IoT sensors provide a constant stream of data. The cloud-based IoT services that were first employed suffer from increased latency and inefficient resource use. Fog computing is used to address these issues by moving cloud services closer to the edge in a small-scale, dispersed fashion. Fog computing is quickly gaining popularity as an effective paradigm for providing customers with real-time processing, platforms, and software services. Real-time applications may be supported at a reduced operating cost using an integrated fog-cloud environment that minimizes resources and reduces delays. Load balancing is a critical problem in fog computing because it ensures that the dynamic load is distributed evenly across all fog nodes, avoiding the situation where some nodes are overloaded while others are underloaded. Numerous algorithms have been proposed to accomplish this goal. In this paper, a framework was proposed that contains three subsystems named user subsystem, cloud subsystem, and fog subsystem. The goal of the proposed framework is to decrease bandwidth costs while providing load balancing at the same time. To optimize the use of all the resources in the fog sub-system, a Fog-Cluster-Based Load-Balancing approach along with a refresh period was proposed. The simulation results show that “Fog-Cluster-Based Load Balancing” decreases energy consumption, the number of Virtual Machines (VMs) migrations, and the number of shutdown hosts compared with existing algorithms for the proposed framework. © 2022 by the authors.

Thus, usable and well-understood modeling methods are required for software architects. For this aim, several specific software architecture modeling methods as well as generic design methods included in software development methodologies are available.

One of the principal causes of such a lack of specific guidance is the general-purpose nature of these methods. Therefore, further efforts are required to define domain-specific software architecture methods.

Indeed, novel immersive and mission-critical services necessitate increased computing and network resources, reduced communication latency, and guaranteed reliability. Thus, efficient and adaptive resource management schemes are required to provide and maintain sufficient levels of Quality of Experience (QoE) during the service life-cycle. Service migration is considered a key enabler of dynamic service orchestration. Indeed, moving services on demand is an efficient mechanism for user mobility support, load balancing in case of fluctuations in service demands, and hardware failure mitigation. However, service migration requires planning, as multiple parameters must be optimized to reduce service disruption to a minimum. Recent breakthroughs in computational capabilities allowed the emergence of Machine Learning as a tool for decision making that is expected to enable seamless automation of network resource management by predicting events and learning optimal decision policies. This paper surveys contributions applying Machine Learning (ML) methods to optimize service migration, providing a detailed literature review on recent advances in the field and establishing a classification of current research efforts with an analysis of their strengths and limitations.

Attackers often abuse API access to exploit these endpoints’ business logic and computing resources. Current intrusion detection systems for large applications deploy entry-level classification to find malicious user requests. However, there is a possibility of attackers showing intrusive behavior after moving past the entry-level checks. In microservice-driven architectures, the API access patterns of normal users are observed to be different from that of attackers. These access patterns consist of APIs called in specific orders reflecting an access graph that depicts user behavior in long-running sessions. This paper presents a mechanism where microservice-based applications are monitored holistically to extract these API call patterns and create a user behavior graph. These graphs are processed as embeddings through representational learning analyzed to classify normal and malicious behavior using machine learning algorithms.

A Safe-aaS infrastructure provides customized safety-related decisions dynamically to the registered end-users. As the decisions are time-sensitive in nature, the generation of these decisions should incur minimum latency and high accuracy. Further, scalability and extension of the coverage of the entire Safe-aaS platform are also necessary. Considering road transportation as the application scenario, we propose Safe-aaS, which is a microservices- and deep learning-based platform for provisioning ultra-low latency safety services to the end-users in a 6G scenario. We design the proposed solution in two stages. In the first stage, we develop the microservices-enabled application layer to improve the scalability and adaptability of the traditional Safe-aaS platform. Moreover, we apply the state space model to represent the decision parameters requested and the decision delivered to the end-users. During the second stage, we use deep learning models to improve the accuracy in the decisions delivered to the end-users. Additionally, we apply an assortment of activation functions to analyze and compare the accuracy of the decisions generated in the proposed scheme.

However, GPUs are hardware processors with high power consumption. To have the least energy consumption while meeting latency Service-Level-Objective (SLO), batching strategy and dynamic voltage frequency scaling (DVFS) are two important solutions. However, existing studies do not coordinate them and regard CNN as a black box, which makes inference services less energy-efficient. In this paper, we propose EALI, an energy-aware layer-level adaptive scheduling framework that is comprised of a power prediction model, a layer combination strategy, and an energy-aware layer-level scheduler. The power prediction model uses classic machine learning techniques to predict fine-grained layer-level power consumption. The layer combination strategy combines multiple layers into optimization units to lower scheduling overhead and complexity. The energy-aware layer-level scheduler adaptively coordinates batching strategy and layer-level DVFS according to workloads to minimize the energy consumption while meeting SLO.

The high quantity of mobile users, both consuming and producing these services to and from the Cloud Computing (CC), can outpace the available bandwidth capacity. Fog Computing (FG) presents itself as a solution to improve on this and other issues. With a reduction in network latency, real-time applications benefit from improved response time and greater overall user experience. Taking this into account, the main goal of this work is threefold. Firstly, it is proposed a method to build an environment based on Cloud–Fog Computing (CFC). Secondly, it is designed two models based on Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The goal is to predict demand and reserve the nodes’ storage capacity to improve the positioning of multimedia services. Later, an algorithm for the multimedia service placement problem which is aware of data traffic prediction is proposed. The goal is to select the minimum number of nodes, considering their hardware capacities for providing multimedia services in such a way that the latency for servicing all the demands is minimized. An evaluation with actual data showed that the proposed algorithm selects the nodes closer to the user to meet their demands. This improves the services delivered to end-users and enhances the deployed network to mitigate provider costs. Moreover, reduce the demand to Cloud allowing turning off servers in the data center not to waste energy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Cloud-to-fog networks; Multimedia services; Placement strategies","Bandwidth; Digital storage; Fog; Fog computing; Long short-term memory; Mobile telecommunication systems; Available bandwidth; Bandwidth capacity; Cloud-computing; Cloud-to-fog network; Explosive growth; Mobile communications; Mobile users; Placement algorithm; Placement strategy; Service placements; Multimedia services","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129727384"

Edge resources need to be utilized efficiently to fulfill the growing demand for a large number of IoT devices. Lots of work has been done for the efficient utilization of edge resources. This paper provided a systematic review of fog resource management literature from the year 2016–2021. In this review paper, the fog resource management approaches are divided into 9 categories which include resource scheduling, application placement, load balancing, resource allocation, resource estimation, task offloading, resource provisioning, resource discovery, and resource orchestration. These resource management approaches are further subclassified based on the technology used, QoS factors, and data-driven strategies. Comparative analysis of existing articles is provided based on technology, tools, application area, and QoS factors.

This paper introduces STS4IoT, a UML profile and automatic code-generation tool for model-driven IoT, to address this issue. STS4IoT allows designing and implementing an IoT application from the required data only, bridging the gaps between the IoT and database design worlds. The IoT data design includes both different in-network transformations and the join of streams from multiple sources. Besides, it follows the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) guidelines to provide abstraction levels oriented to the different roles participating in the application design. The STS4IoT validation shows it has an excellent structure and is highly understandable. Its instance models are well-formed, highly abstract and readable. And the automatic implementation tool can generate complete code for complex real-world applications involving multiple IoT devices.

MCC's use may be restricted because of increasing energy utilization and restricted access to energy supplies. This challenge may be tackled using the green approach, which entails the development of several algorithms or approaches to attain the highest possible degree of service quality. Several techniques in this idea allow consumers to offload data processing and storage to cloud-based servers to reduce the energy utilization of mobile nodes. Offloading is an essential element that helps MCC reduce task load and optimize data storage utilizing a cloud resource pool. Regarding the advantages of the offloading procedure, issues such as reliability (node failure), energy efficiency (energy consumption, task processing), and time management (execution time and task deadline) must be handled. This work presents a unique offloading approach in green MCC depending on a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm because of the NP-Hard nature of the issue. The African Wild Dog Algorithm (AWDA) and the cellular learning automata technique are merged to generate better responses. AWDA is based on the cooperative hunting behavior of African wild dogs. The quantity of cooperative hunters determines the efficacy of hunting. The optimization procedure is analogous to this collective hunting behavior. Furthermore, a learning automaton in the cellular learning automata technique describes each of these components. An element's learning automaton seeks to discover which action best complements its surrounding components. The simulation findings illustrated that the suggested hybrid technique outperforms the other algorithms regarding energy consumption, delay time, and cost.

To overcome this limitation we propose GOAL, an adaptation framework distinguished by its virtualized adaptation logic implemented independently of any specific goals or knobs. GOAL supports this logic with a programming interface allowing users to define and manipulate a wide range of goals and knobs within a running program.

Compared with the traditional isolated mode of satellite resources, the current research aims to realize resource sharing through satellite cooperation in satellite edge computing, to solve the problems of limited resources and low service quality of a single satellite. We propose a satellite resource pool architecture-oriented regional task in satellite edge computing. Different from fixed servers in ground systems, the satellite orbital motion brings challenges to the construction of the satellite resource pool. After the capacity planning of the satellite resource pool for regional tasks is given, an algorithm based on search matching is proposed to solve the dynamic satellite selection problem. A ground semi-physical simulation system is built to perform experiments and evaluate the performance of three modes of satellite resource sharing: isolated mode, cooperative mode, and pooled mode. The results show that the pooled mode, compared with the isolated mode, improves the task success rate by 19.52%, and at the same time increases network resources and energy consumption in the same scenario. Compared with the cooperation mode, the performance of task success rate and resource utilization rate is close to that of the pooled mode, but it has more advantages in response time and load balancing of satellite resources. This shows that in the IoT, the resource pool is of great benefit as it improves the task response time and improves the load balance of satellite resources without degrading the performance, which makes sense in task-demanding scenarios. © 2022 by the authors.","capacity planning; load balance; performance evaluation; resources sharing; satellite edge computing; satellite resource pool","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137333049"

However, it requires more fine-grained resource management and orchestration for service provision. Most of the existing microservice orchestration solutions are based on those designed for the traditional cloud. They can only provide coarse-grained resource allocation using possibly conflicting weighted objectives. In this article, we present a fine-grained microservice orchestration approach to provide services online for dynamic requests of IoT applications. By using a fine-grained resource model of energy cost and service end-to-end response time of orchestrated microservices, we formulate the microservice orchestration problem as a multiobjective Markov decision process.

The considerable amount of data generated by the IoT devices needs latency-sensitive processing, which is not feasible by deploying the respective applications in remote Cloud datacentres. Edge/Fog computing, a promising extension of Cloud at the IoT-proximate network, can meet such requirements for smart CPSs. However, the structural and operational differences of Edge/Fog infrastructure resist employing Cloud-based service regulations directly to these environments. As a result, many research works have been recently conducted, focusing on efficient application and resource management in Edge/Fog computing environments. Scalable Edge/Fog infrastructure is a must to validate these policies, which is also challenging to accommodate in the real-world due to high cost and implementation time. Considering simulation as a key to this constraint, various software have been developed that can imitate the physical behavior of Edge/Fog computing environments. Nevertheless, the existing simulators often fail to support advanced service management features because of their monolithic architecture, lack of actual dataset, and limited scope for a periodic update. To overcome these issues, we have developed modular simulation models for service migration, dynamic distributed cluster formation, and microservice orchestration for Edge/Fog computing based on real datasets and extended the basic components of iFogSim, a widely used Edge/Fog computing simulator for their ease of adoption as iFogSim2. The performance of iFogSim2 and its built-in service management policies are evaluated using three use case scenarios and compared with the contemporary simulators and benchmark policies under different settings. Results indicate that our simulator consumes less memory and minimizes simulation time by an average of 28% when compared to other simulators. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Clustering; Edge/Fog computing; Internet of Things; Microservices; Mobility; Simulation","Benchmarking; Cluster computing; Computer software; Environmental management; Fog computing; Simulators; Building blockes; Clusterings; Computing environments; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Datacenter; Edge/fog computing; Microservice; Mobility; Simulation; Internet of things","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130094579"

Such demands cover emerging applications, such as remote surgeries in Smart Health use cases, whose latency and reliability network requirements cannot be met by current communication systems; or simply improving current applications with more challenging requirements to be achieved, such as increasing the transmission rate in a mobile network, offering Quality of Service (QoS), and consequently, better user experience. Therefore, enabling technologies must be chosen to design an appropriate 6G architecture to address such demands. However, the explosion of emerging applications focused on different scopes and requirements to be met makes choosing these enabling technologies extremely complex and unpredictable. Thus, this article aims to create a methodology for analyzing the relevance of enabling technologies and use it to design an optimal architecture capable of meeting the 6G demands. For this purpose, two methods named as Average (AVG) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) have been selected, whose objective is to determine the relevance of an enabler for the 6G architecture, taking into account different degrees of influencing variables for this analysis, such as adherence to a certain architectural model; popularity in the research area; degree of innovation; synergy with other enablers; and support for requirements. Each of these methods presents a particular result. In the case of the AVG method, the criteria and variables are evaluated independently, and the arithmetic mean is employed to combine the evaluations into a single measure of suitability. In contrast, the AHP method considers the relative importance of criteria and variables in order to classify an optimal set of enabling technologies capable of fulfilling the key roles to be performed by a 6G architecture, and consequently meeting the main 6G demands. Our evaluation provides a unique perspective on 6G enablers, identifying issues and fostering research for future mobile architectures. The results obtained also provide researchers with the necessary information to stay updated on emerging enabling technologies and their suitability for designing new optimized 6G architectures.  © 2013 IEEE.","6G architectures; 6G enabling technologies; 6G requirements; 6G use cases; AHP; relevance analysis","4G mobile communication systems; Analytic hierarchy process; Hierarchical systems; Quality of service; 6g architecture; 6g enabling technology; 6g mobile communication; 6g requirement; 6g use case; Emerging applications; Enabling technologies; Mobile communications; Relevance analysis; Users' experiences; Network architecture","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166764872"

The main findings showed that the primary goal of EC is to reduce the time required to transfer large amounts of data. With the ability to analyze data at the edge, it is possible to obtain immediate feedback and use it in the decision-making process. However, the implementation of EC requires investments not only in infrastructure, but also in the development of employee knowledge related to modern computing methods based on artificial intelligence. As the results of the analyses showed, great importance is also attached to energy consumption, both in ongoing production processes and for the purposes of data transmission and analysis.

Hence, effective workflow scheduling strategies in cloud environments are in high demand. However, existing scheduling algorithms are grounded on an idealized target platform model where virtual machines are fully connected, and all communications can be performed concurrently. A significant aspect neglected by them is endpoint communication contention when executing workflows, which has a large impact on workflow makespan. This article investigates how to incorporate contention awareness into cloud workflow scheduling and proposes a new practical scheduling model. Endpoint communication contention-aware List Scheduling Heuristic (ELSH) is designed to minimize workflow makespan. It uses a novel task ranking property and schedules data communications to communication resources besides scheduling tasks to computing resources. Moreover, a rescheduling technique is employed to improve the schedule. In experiments, ELSH is evaluated against the traditional contention-oblivious list scheduling algorithm, which is adapted to address contention during execution in practice. The experimental results reveal that ELSH performs more efficaciously compared with the adapted traditional ones. Note to Practitioners - This article aims to advance the state of the art for workflow scheduling in clouds by taking into account endpoint communication contention that can occur in practice but has largely been neglected in existing investigations. A scheduling method called Endpoint communication contention-aware List Scheduling Heuristic (ELSH) is then proposed to optimize workflow makespan. Experimental results based on synthetic and realistic workflows show that ELSH performs better than traditional scheduling algorithms that fail to consider endpoint communication contention, especially for the workflow with a large communication-to-computation-cost ratio. The proposed approach can be readily put into use and help cloud service providers to offer their customers high-quality services when executing the latter's workflows.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Cloud computing; directed acyclic graph; endpoint communication contention; list scheduling; workflow scheduling","Automation; Electrical engineering; Communication contention; Communication resources; Contention awareness; Data-communication; Execution environments; List scheduling algorithms; Workflow applications; Workflow scheduling; Scheduling","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100848976"

Unfortunately, cloud datacenters are located far away from IoT devices, and consequently, the transmission of IoT data may be delayed. In this paper, we investigate fog computing, which is a new paradigm that overcomes many issues of cloud computing. More importantly, dynamic task offloading in fog computing is a challenging problem that requires an optimal decision for processing the tasks that are generated in each time slot. Thus, exact optimization methods based on Lyapunov function have been widely used for solving dynamic offloading which represents an NP hard problem. To overcome the scalability issue of exact optimization techniques, we have explored famous population based meta-heuristics for optimizing the offloading process of a set of dynamic tasks using Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) communication. Hence, a parallel multi-threading framework is proposed for generating the optimal offloading solution while selecting the best sub-carrier for each offloaded task. More importantly, our contribution associates a thread for each IoT device and generates a population of random solutions. Next, each population is updated and evaluated according to the proposed fitness function that considers a tradeoff between the delay and energy consumption. Upon the arrival of new tasks at each time slot, an evaluation is performed for maintaining some individuals of the previous population while generating new individuals based on some criteria. Our results have been compared to the results achieved using Lyapunov optimization. They demonstrate the convergence of the fitness function, the scalability of the parallel Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) approach, and the performance in terms of the offline error and the execution cost. © 2022 by the authors.

Nowadays, with the breakout development of science and technology, electric energy sources are formed by many different technologies such as hydroelectricity, solar power, wind power, coal power, etc. These energy sources are connected to form grid systems to transmit electricity to cities, businesses and homes for life and work.

Additionally, PLF contributes to optimizing the ability to manage and monitor animal welfare while providing solutions to global grand challenges posed by the growing demand for animal products and ensuring global food security. By enabling a return to the ""per animal""approach by harnessing technological advancements, PLF enables cost-effective, individualized care for animals through enhanced monitoring and control capabilities within complex farming systems. Meeting the nutritional requirements of a global population exponentially approaching ten billion people will likely require the density of animal proteins for decades to come. The development and application of digital technologies are critical to facilitate the responsible and sustainable intensification of livestock production over the next several decades to maximize the potential benefits of PLF. Real-time continuous monitoring of each animal is expected to enable more precise and accurate tracking and management of health and well-being. Importantly, the digitalization of agriculture is expected to provide collateral benefits of ensuring auditability in value chains while assuaging concerns associated with labor shortages. Despite notable advances in PLF technology adoption, a number of critical concerns currently limit the viability of these state-of-the-art technologies. The potential benefits of PLF for livestock management systems which are enabled by autonomous continuous monitoring and environmental control can be rapidly enhanced through an Internet of Things approach to monitoring and (where appropriate) closed-loop management. In this paper, we analyze the multilayered network of sensors, actuators, communication, networking, and analytics currently used in PLF, focusing on dairy farming as an illustrative example. We explore the current state-of-the-art, identify key shortcomings, and propose potential solutions to bridge the gap between technology and animal agriculture. Additionally, we examine the potential implications of advancements in communication, robotics, and artificial intelligence on the health, security, and welfare of animals. © 2023 The Author(s).

In this respect, this work presents the development of a software platform using the Scrum methodology and the integrated technology of the Internet of Things for monitoring and managing inpatient safety. A modular solution is developed under a hexagonal architecture, using PHP as the backend language through the Laravel framework. A MySQL database was used for the data layer, and Vue.js was used for the user interface. This work implemented an RFID-based nurse call system using Internet of Things (IoT) concepts. The system enables nurses to respond to each inpatient within a given time limit and without the inpatient or a family member having to approach the nursing station. The system also provides reports and indicators that help evaluate the quality of inpatient care and helps to take measures to improve inpatient safety during care. In addition, diet management is integrated to reduce the occurrence of adverse events. A LoRa and Wi-Fi-based IoT network was implemented using a LoRa transceiver and the ESP32 MCU, chosen for its low power consumption, low cost, and wide availability. Bidirectional communication between hardware and software is handled through an MQTT Broker. The system integrates temperature and humidity sensors and smoke sensors, among others. © 2022 by the authors.","adverse event; hexagonal architecture; inpatient safety; IoT","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144694824"

The need for sustainable technologies and solutions for energy-saving dramatically increased in residential buildings due to population growth, quality of indoor environment, and climate change. Recently, IoT based applications have been developed in smart homes, smart cities, smart hospitals, and other smart environments. The goals of sustainable technologies in residential buildings incorporate maximization of thermal comfort and minimizing energy consumption. The challenges and problems of residential buildings can be solved using consumer behavior models and integrating their inference into residential problem solutions. This paper proposes an IoT task management mechanism based on predictive optimization for energy consumption minimization in smart residential buildings. The proposed task management mechanism has a predictive optimization module based on prediction and an optimization module for solving energy consumption minimization problems. The energy data is obtained from different appliances to evaluate the proposed predictive optimization approach. The proposed approach results are compared with prediction and optimization modules. The performance is evaluated in terms of regression performance metrics.

One way of keeping honey bees healthy is to be able to monitor and control the general conditions in a beehive and also outside of a beehive. Monitoring systems offer an effective way of accessing, visualizing, sharing, and managing data that is gathered from performed agricultural and livestock activities for domain stakeholders. Such systems have recently been implemented based on wireless sensor networks (WSN) and IoT to monitor the activities of honey bees in beehives as well. Scholars have shown considerable interests in proposing IoT- and WSN-based beehive monitoring systems, but much of the research up to now lacks in proposing appropriate architecture for open data driven beehive monitoring systems. Developing a robust monitoring system based on a contemporary software architecture such as microservices can be of great help to be able to control the activities of honey bees and more importantly to be able to keep them healthy in beehives. This research sets out to design and implementation of a sustainable WSN-based beehive monitoring platform using a microservice architecture. We pointed out that by adopting microservices one can deal with long-standing problems with heterogeneity, interoperability, scalability, agility, reliability, maintainability issues, and in turn achieve sustainable WSN-based beehive monitoring systems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Beehive monitoring system; Microservices in agriculture and livestock; Microservices in beehive; Open data in beehive; Smart beehive","Food products; Internet of things; Interoperability; Monitoring; Network architecture; Open Data; Wireless sensor networks; Beehive monitoring system; Design and implementations; Honey bee; Microservice in agriculture and livestock; Microservice in beehive; Monitoring system; Network-based; Open data in beehive; Open datum; Smart beehive; agriculture; design method; Internet; livestock; monitoring system; Agriculture","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127333524"

WSN is utilized to monitor, report, and supervise tasks or events occurring in the environment. The relaying of data in such systems takes place by utilizing different routing schemes. These routing schemes were proposed to augment the throughput of communication networks. In addition, perception regarding the Internet of Things (IoT) gained momentum via making it feasible for things to interact and act smartly. In this paper, a meticulous survey of solutions proposed in both the domains i.e. WSN and IoT is conferred. Later, comprehensive scrutiny of various solutions proposed in the WSN and IoT domain is deliberated regarding their features, pros, and cons. Moreover, this work compares various proposed solutions based on performance measures like heterogeneity, interoperability, mobility, reusability, flexibility, energy efficiency, scalability, delay, security as well as big data. This knowledge enables the network architect to pick the apt solution in support of a specific application. As the integration of WSN and IoT raised numerous open issues, this work deliberated the afore-mentioned performance measures as the key open issues of interest.

In order to deeply mine and present the value of platform data in multiple dimensions, this research used methods such as point centrality, betweenness centrality and spatial clustering to analyze the fission relationship, diffusion capacity, and community characteristics of the questionnaire dissemination network. (2) System realization: two subsystems were developed by adopting the front-end and back-end separation mode, namely, the rapid investigation collection system for survey users, and the rapid investigation management and analysis system for the information investigators. (3) Application: VMware vSphere integrated container and cluster server were used to deploy system and Nginx load balancing to improve system response speed. 【Result】 After six months of continuous operation, the system had strong universality. It has provided 12 large-scale agricultural and rural information survey services in 8 fields and collected a total of 76 953 questionnaires; In the agricultural and rural economic information survey cases 12 243 questionnaires have been collected within 5 hours, with a fission ratio of 88.23%, of which 20.24% formed diffusion and fission. The community effect was obvious, with high degree of fission, fast speed and wide range. The platform had strong comprehensive functions, covering the functions of questionnaire design, placement control, fission sharing, intelligent judgment of papers, reward distribution, statistical analysis, user classification, etc., which could provide one-stop service for rapid investigation of agricultural and rural information. 【Conclusion】The rapid investigation and analysis platform of agricultural and rural information based on fission mode had the characteristics of fast data collection, true information acquisition, more sample collection, and strong functionality. It realized the function of obtaining basic information urgently and visualizing investigation results quickly under the background of emergencies, and formed a poll mode based on huge data and different from official investigation. It could provide strong technical support for efficient decision-making of agricultural management departments, and had reference significance for the information investigation of other industries. © 2022 Editorial Department of Scientia Agricultura Sinica.

In particular, there is no general scalability assessment which clearly indicates whether a system scales or not or whether a system scales better than another. The key contribution of this article is the definition of a scalability index (SI) which quantifies if a system scales in comparison to another system, a hypothetical system, e.g., linear system, or the theoretically optimal system. The suggested SI generalizes different metrics from literature, which are specialized cases of our SI. The primary target of our scalability framework is, however, benchmarking of two systems, which does not require any reference system. The SI is demonstrated and evaluated for different use cases, that are (1) the performance of an IoT load balancer depending on the system load, (2) the availability of a communication system depending on the size and structure of the network, (3) scalability comparison of different location selection mechanisms in fog computing with respect to delays and energy consumption; (4) comparison of time-sensitive networking (TSN) mechanisms in terms of efficiency and utilization. Finally, we discuss how to use and how not to use the SI and give recommendations and guidelines in practice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which provides a general SI for the comparison and benchmarking of systems, which is the primary target of our scalability analysis. © 2013 IEEE.","availability; Communication networks; performance; scalability","Benchmarking; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fog computing; Green computing; Linear systems; Telecommunication networks; Communications networks; Communications systems; Index; Networks and systems; Performance; Performances evaluation; Reference systems; Stringents; Time factors; Scalability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171571441"

Internal designs for each of these models is highly complex, and varies in terms of quantitative & qualitative performance measures. This is due to their variation in terms of design nuances, functional advantages, context-based limitations, and possible deployment-specific future scopes. Due to this variation, it is highly ambiguous to select these models for performance-specific IoT deployments. Moreover, these models also vary in terms of security level, Quality of Service (QoS) parameters, scalability performance, computational complexity, deployment costs, and other performance metrics. Thus, to identify optimum models, researchers & network designers are required to test & validate multiple security models for their deployments. Due to which, the cost & time to market for IoT devices is increased, thereby affecting viability of IoT products. To overcome these selection issues, an empirical survey of different IoT security models including block-chains, encryption techniques, hashing models, privacy preservation techniques, machine learning based security methods, etc. are discussed in this text. This text also discusses various attack mitigation models that provide node-level security, network-level security, physical security, & route-level security. This discussion will assist in initially evaluating different operating characteristics of these models, which will allow readers to identify most suited models for their application-specific use cases. This article also assesses the models' performance in terms of computational latency, energy consumption, security levels, deployment complexity, and scalability measures. These metrics are compared between different security models, which will further assist readers to identify optimum models for their performance-specific use cases. To further assist in model selection, this text proposes evaluation of a novel IoT Security Performance Rank (ISRP), that combines various performance metrics to form a singular rank which can be used to describe overall performance of these models.

The consequent resource contention has an undesirable effect on latency-sensitive tasks. In this article, we present Niyama—a resource isolation approach that uses a modified version of deadline scheduling to protect latency-sensitive tasks from CPU bandwidth contention. Conventionally, deadline scheduling has been used to schedule real-time tasks with well-defined deadlines. Therefore, it cannot be used directly when the deadlines are unspecified. In Niyama, we estimate deadlines in intervals and secure bandwidth required for the interval, thereby ensuring optimal job response times. We compare our approach with cgroups: Linux's default resource isolation mechanism used in containers today. Our experiments show that Niyama reduces the average delay in tasks by 3 (Formula presented.) –20 (Formula presented.) when compared to cgroups. Since Linux's deadline scheduling policy is work-conserving in nature, there is a small drop in the server-level CPU utilization when Niyama is used naively. We demonstrate how the use of core reservation and oversubscription in the inter-node scheduler can be used to offset this drop; our experiments show a 1.3 (Formula presented.) –2.24 (Formula presented.) decrease in delay in job response time over cgroups while achieving high CPU utilization. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","cgroups; containers; resource isolation","Bandwidth; Drops; Linux; Scheduling; Cgroup; Cloud providers; CPU utilization; Deadline scheduling; Job response time; Multiple applications; Node scheduling; Resource contention; Resource isolation; Resources utilizations; Containers","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135393132"

However, MDs are constrained by their limited resources and cannot execute computation-intensive applications. Mobile cloud computing (MCC), which provides MDs with a rich pool of resources that can be accessed through wireless networks, is proposed to extend MDs’ capacity by computation offloading. MCC helps MDs breakthrough their resource constraints, frees them from heavy local workloads, and allows them to take more responsibility for connecting mobile users (MUs) and the information domain. MCC computation offloading has attracted wide attention because of its tremendous potential, and a lot of related research has been done. In this paper, we provide a survey of the research on computation offloading in MCC so that readers can spend less time to have a comprehensive understanding of this field, and know its key technologies and future directions. We first summarize the MCC architecture and offloading granularity, which are the most fundamental concepts of MCC. The computation offloading system is decomposed into three basic components: MUs, application service operators, and cloud operators. We then conducted a comprehensive literature review on offloading decision, admission control, resource management, and edge equipment deployment, which are four key technologies for these components. Wireless network connection and heterogeneity are the basic features of MCC, which increase the possibility of failure and privacy leakage during the computation offloading process. We also review the auxiliary technologies for computation offloading in terms of fault tolerance and privacy protection. Finally, we present the research outlook of the systematic prototype and other technologies from the perspective of “device-pipe-cloud”. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Computation offloading; Edge equipment deployment; Fault tolerance; Mobile cloud computing; Offloading decision; Privacy protection; Resource management","Decision making; Fault tolerance; Mobile cloud computing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Natural resources management; Surveys; Wireless networks; Computation intensives; Computation offloading; Edge equipment deployment; Key technologies; Mobile users; Offloading decision; Privacy protection; Resource Constraint; Resource management; Smart phones; Resource allocation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125649394"

Moreover, the increase in the volume of data and their transmission through the Internet of Things, as well as the existence of inadequate bandwidth, limits cloud-based storage and data processing. Both fog and cloud computing provide the storage space, application, and data for users; however, fog is more proximate to the end user with wider geographical distribution. When bringing the computing resources closer to the required location in the fog environment, the efficiency of the system increases, and the distance at which data must be transmitted decreases. On the other hand, implementing IoT applications and satisfying the requests of end users in fog computing will create new challenges in resource allocation and dynamic resource provisioning. The flexible and usually automatic mechanisms require the determination of required virtual resources to minimize the resource consumption and service level agreement (SLA). In this paper, we introduce a framework for increasing resource management efficiency in the IoT ecosystem based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The proposed deep neural network (DNN) method for estimating value functions improves adaptability to different oscillating conditions, learns past sensible strategies, and as a self-learning adaptive system by replicating interactions with the fog environment. The DRL algorithm finds the best destination for implementing IoT services to compromise between minimizing average power consumption, minimizing average service latency, reducing costs, and balancing resource allocation. Finally, through simulations, we show that under different loading rates, the policy used compared to other comparable solutions is to increase utilization and reduce the rate of delay, while ensuring an acceptable level of service quality. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Application-based services; Auto-scaling; Deep reinforcement learning; Fog computing; Internet of Things (IoT); Resource provisioning","Data handling; Deep neural networks; Digital storage; Efficiency; Fog; Fog computing; Geographical distribution; Learning systems; Quality of service; Reinforcement learning; Resource allocation; Application-based service; Auto-scaling; Deep reinforcement learning; End-users; Internet of thing; Reinforcement learnings; Resource provisioning; Resources allocation; Scalings; Self-learning; Internet of things","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129862924"

In this article, an energy-efficient resource management framework for IIoT with closed-loop control on end devices, edge servers, and cloud center is studied. In the considered model, each edge server aggregates the data collected by industrial sensors (i.e., end devices) and forms computation tasks for corresponding data analysis. In order to minimize the system-wide energy consumption, while maintaining a guaranteed service delay and a satisfied data processing accuracy for each IIoT application, a joint optimization of: 1) sensors' sampling rate adaption; 2) edge servers' preprocessing mode selection; and 3) edge-cloud communication and computing resource allocation is formulated. Further taking into account the time-varying channel conditions and randomness of data arrivals, we propose a low-complexity online algorithm, which solves the problem in a dynamic manner. Particularly, the Lyapunov optimization method is first utilized to decompose the long-term problem into a series of instant ones [mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems], and then a Markov approximation algorithm is applied to solve such instant problems to near optimum with the consideration of future impacts. Performance analyses and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is feasible under long-term service satisfaction constraints, and its energy consumption and service delay are approximately 20% and 28% lower than those of the benchmark schemes, respectively.  © 2022 IEEE.","Communication and computing resource allocation; edgea-cloud collaboration; Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); online optimization; preprocessing mode selection; sampling rate adaption","Approximation algorithms; Benchmarking; Computational complexity; Data handling; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Green computing; Information management; Integer programming; Internet of things; Natural resources management; Nonlinear programming; Cloud-computing; Collaboration; Communication and computing resource allocation; Communication resources; Computing resource; Delay; Edge clouds; Edge-cloud collaboration; Energy-consumption; Mode selection; Online optimization; Online optimization.; Preprocessing mode selection; Rate adaptions; Resource management; Resources allocation; Sampling rate adaption; Sampling rates; Resource allocation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124715196"

However, current technical solutions can only partially handle the data outburst associated with the IoT proliferation experienced in recent years, mainly due to their hierarchical architectures. In this context, this paper presents a reference architecture of a meta-operating system (RAMOS), targeted to enable a dynamic, distributed and trusted continuum which will be capable of facilitating the next-generation smart applications at the edge. RAMOS is domain-agnostic, capable of supporting heterogeneous devices in various network environments. Furthermore, the proposed architecture possesses the ability to place the data at the origin in a secure and trusted manner. Based on a layered structure, the building blocks of RAMOS are thoroughly described, and the interconnection and coordination between them is fully presented. Furthermore, illustration of how the proposed reference architecture and its characteristics could fit in potential key industrial and societal applications, which in the future will require more power at the edge, is provided in five practical scenarios, focusing on the distributed intelligence and privacy preservation principles promoted by RAMOS, as well as the concept of environmental footprint minimization.

This then cascades into the four stages of the IoT architectural layout: sensors and actuators; gateways and data acquisition systems; edge IT data processing; and datacenter and cloud, which use high-end apps to collect data, evaluate it, process it, and provide remedial solutions. This elegant combination provides excellent value in automatic action. In the future, IoT will continue to serve as the foundation for many technologies.

Nonetheless, they often suffer from high overhead of communications over network and/or PCIe links. To tackle the limitations of the current solutions, this paper proposes RAMBDA, a holistic network and architecture co-design solution that leverages current RDMA and emerging cache-coherent off-chip interconnect technologies. Specifically, RAMBDA consists of four hardware and software components: (1) unified abstraction of inter- and intra-machine communications synergistically managed by one-sided RDMA write and cache-coherent memory write; (2) efficient notification of requests to accelerators assisted by cache coherence; (3) cache-coherent accelerator architecture directly interacting with NIC; and (4) adaptive device-to-host data transfer for modern server memory systems comprising both DRAM and NVM exploiting state-of-the-art features in CPUs and PCIe. We prototype RAMBDA with a commercial system and evaluate three popular datacenter applications: (1) in-memory key-value store, (2) chain replication-based distributed transaction system, and (3) deep learning recommendation model inference. The evaluation shows that RAMBDA provides 30.1~69.1% lower latency, 0.2~2.5× throughput, and ~ 3× higher energy efficiency than the current state-of-the-art solutions, including Smart NIC. For those cases where Rambda performs poorly, we also envision future architecture to improve it. © 2023 IEEE.","cache-coherent interconnects and accelerators; datacenters; heterogeneous and disaggregated memory; RDMA","Cache memory; Data transfer; Deep learning; Dynamic random access storage; Energy efficiency; Integrated circuit interconnects; Machine components; Memory architecture; Network architecture; 'current; Cache-coherent interconnect and accelerator; Co-designs; Datacenter; Design solutions; Dis-aggregated memory; Diverse solutions; Heterogeneous memory; RDMA; State of the art; Program processors","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151616209"

It is through these principles that are influenced by information and communication technologies (ICT), Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence, that the practices employed by citizens and their interaction with electronic government (e-government) are diversified. Previously, the misleading concepts of the smart city implied only the objective of the local level or public officials to utilize technology. However, the recent European experience and research studies have led to a more comprehensive notion that refers to the search for intelligent solutions which allow modern sustainable cities to enhance the quality of services provided to citizens and to improve the management of urban mobility. The smart city is based on the usage of connected sensors, data management, and analytics platforms to improve the quality and functioning of built-environment systems. The aim of this paper is to understand the effects of the pandemic on smart cities and to accentuate major exercises that can be learned for post-COVID sustainable urban management and patterns. The lessons and implications outlined in this paper can be used to enforce social distancing community measures in an effective and timely way, and to optimize the use of resources in smart and sustainable cities in critical situations. The paper offers a conceptual overview and serves as a stepping-stone to extensive research and the deployment of sustainable smart city platforms and intelligent transportation systems (a sub-area of smart city applications) after the COVID-19 pandemic using a case study from Russia. Overall, our results demonstrate that the COVID-19 crisis encompasses an excellent opportunity for urban planners and policy makers to take transformative actions towards creating cities that are more intelligent and sustainable. © 2022 by the authors.

However, IoT application systems have often been designed and deployed independently without considering the standards of devices, logics, and data communications. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of the IoT server platform called Smart Environmental Monitoring and Analytical in Real-Time (SEMAR) for integrating IoT application systems using standards. SEMAR offers Big Data environments with built-in functions for data aggregations, synchronizations, and classifications with machine learning. Moreover, plug-in functions can be easily implemented. Data from devices for different sensors can be accepted directly and through network connections, which will be used in real-time for user interfaces, text files, and access to other systems through Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface (REST API) services. For evaluations of SEMAR, we implemented the platform and integrated five IoT application systems, namely, the air-conditioning guidance system, the fingerprint-based indoor localization system, the water quality monitoring system, the environment monitoring system, and the air quality monitoring system. When compared with existing research on IoT platforms, the proposed SEMAR IoT application server platform offers higher flexibility and interoperability with the functions for IoT device managements, data communications, decision making, synchronizations, and filters that can be easily integrated with external programs or IoT applications without changing the codes. The results confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposal. © 2022 by the authors.","Internet of Things; IoT application system; MQTT; REST API; SEMAR; sensor; server platform","Air conditioning; Air quality; Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Convolutional codes; Decision making; Interface states; Monitoring; Real time systems; User interfaces; Water quality; Application systems; Applications programming interfaces; Environmental Monitoring; Internet of thing application system; MQTT; Real- time; Representational state transfer; Representational state transfer application programming interface; Server platform; Smart environmental monitoring and analytical in real-time; Internet of things","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137548363"

By feeding previous power electronic data into the learning model, accurate information is drawn, and the quality of IoT-based power services is improved. Generally, the data-intensive electronic applications with machine learning are split into numerous data/control constrained tasks by workflow technology. The efficient execution of this data-intensive Power Workflow (PW) needs massive computing resources, which are available in the cloud infrastructure. Nevertheless, the execution efficiency of PW decreases due to inappropriate sub-task and data placement. In addition, the power consumption explodes due to massive data acquisition. To address these challenges, a PW placement method named PWP is devised. Specifically, the Non-dominated Sorting Differential Evolution (NSDE) is used to generate placement strategies. The simulation experiments show that PWP achieves the best trade-off among data acquisition time, power consumption, load distribution and privacy preservation, confirming that PWP is effective for the placement problem. © 2021 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Cloud; IoT-based power system; Machine learning; NSDE; Workflow","Computing power; Data acquisition; Economic and social effects; Electric power utilization; Green computing; Machine learning; Optimization; Power quality; Data intensive; Data-intensive application; Differential Evolution; Internet of thing-based power system; Machine-learning; Non-dominated Sorting; Non-dominated sorting differential evolution; Power; Splittings; Work-flows; Internet of things","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131805816"

As a kind of solid waste, HR still contains a large amount of organic matter, which requires further industrial extraction procedure. Most of the existing studies are concerned with the feasibility of utilizing traditional Chinese medicine residues, meanwhile there are very few studies regarding the kinetics of pyrolysis in the process of resource utilization of traditional Chinese medicine residues. In this study, we comprehensively studied the kinetics characteristics of raw materials with various heating rates (10, 20, 30, and 40°C/min) using a synchronous thermogravimetric analysis, and we adopted Coats-Redfern model to study the thermal kinetics and thermal analysis of GBR. A novel method combining Genetic algorithm and Adaboost algorithm (GA-Adaboost) is proposed to predict the thermogravimetric curve of the raw plant material with respect to the heating rate and temperature. The experimental result shows that the activation energy of the raw material was determined by the Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) ((Formula presented.)), and the correlation coefficient was greater than 0.99. The optimal reaction mechanism determined by the Coats - Redfern method was random nucleation and subsequent growth. The GA-Adaboost model achieved good performance (with a fitting degree of 99.88% on training data, 99.80% on verification data, and MSE of3.4173) while predicting the pyrolysis process of ginkgo biloba residue. This study will provide theoretical basis and technical support for the efficient resource utilization of pharmaceutical residues and reduce environmental pressure.

Kubernetes (K8s) is the de facto distributed operating system for container orchestration, and the extended version of the Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF)- in the Linux (and MS Windows) kernel- is fundamentally changing the approach to cloud-native networking, security, and observability. In this paper, we introduce what eBPF is, its potential for Telco cloud, and review some of the most promising pricing and billing models applied to this revolutionary operating system (OS) technology. These models include schemes based on a data source usage model or the number of eBPF agents deployed on the network, linked to specific eBPF modules. These modules encompass network observability, runtime security, and power dissipation monitoring. Next, we present our eBPF platform, named Sauron in this work, and demonstrate how eBPF allows us to write custom code and dynamically load eBPF programs into the kernel. These programs enable us to estimate the energy consumption of cloud-native functions, derive performance counters and gauges for transport networks, 5G applications, and non-access stratum protocols. Additionally, we can detect and respond to unauthorized access to cloud-native resources in real-time using eBPF.

Although the number and maturity of DT concepts is increasing, there is still no standardized framework available for the implementation of DTs for industrial energy systems (IES). On the one hand, most proposals focus on the conceptual side of components and leave most implementation details unaddressed. Specific implementations, on the other hand, rarely follow recognized reference architectures and standards. Furthermore, most related work on DTs is done in manufacturing, which differs from DTs in energy systems in various aspects, regarding, for example, multiple time-scales, strong nonlinearities and uncertainties. In the present work, we identify the most important requirements for DTs of IES. We propose a DT platform based on the five-dimensional DT modeling concept with a low level of abstraction that is tailored to the identified requirements. We address current technical implementation barriers and provide practical solutions for them. Our work should pave the way to standardized DT platforms and the efficient encapsulation of DT service engineering by domain experts. Thus, DTs could be easy to implement in various IES-related use cases, host any desired models and services, and help get the most out of the individual applications. This ultimately helps bridge the interdisciplinary gap between the latest research on DTs in the domain of computer science and industrial automation and the actual implementation and value creation in the traditional energy sector. © 2022 by the authors.","digital twin platform; digital twin requirements; industrial energy systems; integrated energy systems; service engineering; service-oriented architecture","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136374725"

Sensor data suffers from uncertainty and inconsistency issues, that can affect its accuracy. Several IoT applications are time sensitive, requiring fast data processing. Finally, as IoT devices are often battery powered, processing tasks must be performed in an energy-efficient way. Therefore, challenges in IoT data stream processing span three dimensions: accuracy, latency and energy; and LE-STREAM jointly addresses them. It leverages edge computing to bring the data processing closer to the data sources, thus minimizing latency. Adaptive sampling combined with data prediction model reduce the energy consumption of devices without compromising data accuracy.

From implanted medical devices to motion-activated surveillance cameras and from driverless smart cars to voice-operated home management systems, IoT devices continue to permeate further and deeper into our lives. However, this widespread adoption of IoT devices has also given rise to a wide range of security, privacy and trust issues that are unique to the IoT ecosystem. Conventional solutions are ill-suited for the IoT domain due to limited resources, network dynamics, and evolving trust boundaries. Hence, novel mechanisms are needed to address the specific challenges of the IoT landscape. To this end, we propose a user-centric cloud-based service that allows device owners to have fine-grained control over what kind and how much data is shared through their IoT devices. Our scheme builds on top of Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to instantiate secure virtual clones (shadows) of actual devices in the cloud, substantially reducing the attack surface for IoT networks. Furthermore, a scalable infrastructure in the cloud allows us to deploy sophisticated policy enforcement and data scrubbing mechanisms on a per application basis giving users explicit control over data sharing. The presented approach requires little effort on part of device vendors and users as the service provider handles the bulk of the work. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach empirically by implementing the service on SGX hardware and deploying advanced data cleansing policies on device-generated data. © 2022","Access control; Data privacy; Data scrubbing; Internet of things (IoT); Software guard extensions","Access control; Data privacy; Information services; Network security; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Trusted computing; Data scrubbing; Driverless; Home management; Implanted medical devices; Internet of thing; Low-costs; Smart car; Soa (serviceoriented architecture); Software guard extension; Surveillance cameras; Internet of things","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131968676"

Container placement plays a vital role in network traffic and the performance of containerized data centers. Existing container placement techniques are inadequate due to the ignorance of container traffic patterns. To solve this issue, we first investigate the network traffic between containers and observe that it exhibits a Zipf-like distribution. Motivated by this finding, we propose a novel container placement approach-Blender-by taking into account the Zipf-like distribution. Blender employs two algorithms called RefineAlg and SplitAlg to divide containers of applications into blocks, and place these blocks across Virtual Machines (VMs). Blender exhibits two salient features: (i) it minimizes inter-block traffic by arranging the containers that communicate frequently in the same block. (ii) it achieves good load balancing by combining complementary blocks that request different resource types (e.g., CPU-intensive and memory-intensive blocks) and distributing these blocks across multiple VMs. The experimental results show that Blender significantly reduces communication traffic and network latency. In particular, Blender reduces the traffic of SBP and CA-WFD by 22% and 32%, respectively. Blender decreases network latency by 16% and 26% compared to SBP and CA-WFD. Furthermore, with Blender in place, the physical resources of hosting PMs are well balanced and utilized.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","cloud computing; Container placement; data centers; load balancing; traffic-aware","Blending; Distributed computer systems; Information management; Cloud computing.; Cloud-computing; Container placement; Datacenter; IP-network; Load-Balancing; Microservice architecture; Traffic aware; Zipf-like distribution; Containers","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121777696"

Due to limited computing resource of 5G base stations, not all services can be cached in base stations to meet the resource demands of user requests. Also, if the workload of a 5G base station reaches to its resource capacity, the energy consumption of the base station will be pushed up exponentially. To reduce the energy consumption and overcome resource limitations on base stations, an alternative is to allow the base stations to collaborate with each other to admit user requests. In this paper, we investigate the problem of collaborative service caching and request offloading between a 5G-enabled MEC and remote data centers, while meeting the quality of service (QoS) requirements of users, and resource capacities on base stations that are operated by multiple selfish network service providers. We aim to maximize the total payoff of all base stations. To this end, we first propose a two-stage optimization framework: In the first stage, we develop a mechanism that adopts a best-reply rule for dynamically distributed coalition formation. In the second stage, we propose a near-optimal payoff allocation method by devising a randomized algorithm with a provable approximation ratio. We then evaluate the performance of the proposed optimization framework by extensive experimental simulations. Simulation results show that the proposed framework outperforms its counterparts by achieving at least 30% higher payoff and 20% lower energy consumption of base stations. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","5G networks; approximation algorithms; game theory; Mobile edge computing (MEC); request offloading; service caching","5G mobile communication systems; Approximation algorithms; Base stations; Computation theory; Computer games; Edge computing; Game theory; Green computing; Power management; Quality of service; Queueing networks; Collaboration; Collaborative services; Datacenter; Delay; Energy-consumption; Mobile edge computing; Remote data centers; Request offloading; Resource capacity; Service caching; Energy utilization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118601832"

One common aim is to provide systems able to synchronize these devices, handle the big amount of daily generated data and meet business demands. This paper proposes a cost-effective cloud-based architecture using an event-driven backbone to process many applications’ data in real-time, called REDA. It supports the Amazon Web Service (AWS) IoT core, and it opens the door as a free software-based implementation. Measured data from several wireless sensor nodes are transmitted to the cloud running application through the lightweight publisher/subscriber messaging transport protocol, MQTT. The real-time stream processing platform, Apache Kafka, is used as a message broker to receive data from the producer and forward it to the correspondent consumer. Micro-services design patterns, as an event consumer, are implemented with Java spring and managed with Apache Maven to avoid the monolithic applications’ problem. The Apache Kafka cluster co-located with Zookeeper is deployed over three availability zones and optimized for high throughput and low latency. To guarantee no message loss and to simulate the system performances, different load tests are carried out. The proposed architecture is reliable in stress cases and can handle records goes to 8000 messages in a second with low latency in a cheap hosted and configured architecture. © 2021, The Author(s).","Amazon web service IoT; Cloud computing; Event-driven; Internet of things; Kafka; Micro-services; Wireless sensor network","Computer architecture; Cost effectiveness; Data streams; Internet of things; Sensor nodes; Web services; Cloud-based architectures; Design and implementations; Emerging applications; Event-driven architectures; Internet of thing (IoTs); Proposed architectures; Real-time data processing; Running applications; Network architecture","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111319302"

Meanwhile, approaches to enhance the quality of service (QoS), e.g. network lifetime, energy distribution, and data transmission delay, of an indispensable component of IES, i.e., integrated energy system wireless sensor networks (IESWSNs), have become an urgent research issue. To tackle the issue, a high-performance clustering protocol termed quantum clone whale optimization algorithm (HPCP-QCWOA) is proposed for IESWSNs. By designing a new quantum operator and a new layering clone operator, HPCP-QCWOA can find an approximate optimal clustering scheme to improve the QoS performance of IESWSNs. Unlike other population-based clustering protocols, a new objective function that embraces remaining energy, intra-cluster distance, BS distance, and data transmission delay is designed in the HPCP-QCWOA, which renders its clustering performance more desirable than some other state-of-the-art clustering protocols, i.e., O-LEACH, LDIWPSO, and ARSH-FATI-CHS. Empirically, simulation experiments under different scenarios illustrated that the lifetime of the HPCP-QCWOA-based clustering has increased by 28.78%, 25.50% and 11.22% respectively compared with O-LEACH, LDIWPSO, and ARSH-FATI-CHS. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Clustering; Integrated energy system; Quality of service; Quantum optimization; Whale optimization algorithm; Wireless sensor network","Cloning; Clustering algorithms; Data transfer; Energy resources; Leaching; Optimization; Population statistics; Quality of service; Based clustering; Clustering protocol; Clusterings; Data transmission delay; Integrated energy systems; Optimization algorithms; Performance; Quality-of-service; Quantum optimization; Whale optimization algorithm; Wireless sensor networks","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130609150"

However, the conventional centralized storage system presents a significant impediment, particularly when patients switch healthcare providers. Given the sensitive nature of medical data, retrieving this information from a different healthcare facility can be fraught with challenges. While decentralized storage models using blockchain and smart contracts have been suggested as potential solutions, these methodologies often expose sensitive personal information due to the inherently open nature of data on the blockchain. Addressing these challenges, we present an innovative approach integrating Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to facilitate the creation and sharing of medical document sets based on test results within a medical environment. This novel approach effectively balances data accessibility and security, introducing four key contributions: (a) We introduce a mechanism for sharing medical test results while preserving data privacy. (b) We offer a model for generating certified, NFT-based document sets that encapsulate these results. (c) We provide a proof-of-concept reflecting the proposed model’s functionality and (d) We deploy this proof-of-concept across four EVM-supported platforms—BNB Smart Chain, Fantom, Polygon, and Celo—to identify the most compatible platform for our proposed model.

These IIoT devices generate a massive amount of data called big data. Using fog computing architecture for processing this extensive data will reduce the service time and the service cost for the IIoT applications. The primary challenge is to design better service placement strategies to deploy the IIoT service requests on the fog nodes to minimize service costs and ensure the Quality of Service (QoS) of IIoT applications. Hence, the placement of IIoT services on the fog nodes can be considered as NP-hard problem. In this work, the meta-heuristic-based hybrid algorithms, namely: MGAPSO and EGAPSO, are developed by combining the GA & PSO and Elitism-based GA (EGA) & PSO, respectively. Further, carried out experiments on the two-level fog computing framework developed using docker and containers on 1.4 GHz, 64-bit quad-core processor devices.

However, it is quite complex to provide evidence that an architecture is of good quality and that the architectural decisions are appropriate, correct, or optimal. Architecture evaluation aims at showing and providing confidence that design decisions contribute to fulfilling the stakeholder concerns. Some architecture evaluation methods are scenario-based and aim at balancing many potentially conflicting quality attributes. Other works focus on a specific quality attribute and provide metrics to measure it.In this paper we survey the state of the art in metrics for evaluating quality attributes of architectures. The elicited metrics are organized into a catalog, which associates them with the specific quality attributes they aim to measure. We contribute also an MDE framework that generates web views facilitating the analysis of architectures.

Fog computing, which uses fog nodes close to IoT devices, can solve this problem. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Service Placement (DSP) algorithm for Fog infrastructures. DSP's objective is to dynamically place the services emitted by applications one at a time and in real time on Fog nodes. The algorithm chooses the fog node with the least response time over the infrastructure and dynamically places the incoming service in it. The algorithm is implemented in the iFogSim simulator, and its performances were evaluated and compared to other algorithms. DSP showed very encouraging results, as it proceeded to minimize the average response times and the application placement rate, thus lowering the infrastructure usage and energy consumption.

While Moore's law guided the semiconductor industry to cram more and more transistors and logic into the same volume, the limits of instruction-level parallelism (ILP) and the end of Dennard's scaling drove the industry towards multi-core chips. More recently, we have entered the era of domain-specific architectures (DSA) and chips for new workloads like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). These trends continue, arguably with other limits, along with challenges imposed by tighter integration, extreme form factors and increasingly diverse workloads, making systems more complex to architect, design, implement and optimize from an energy efficiency perspective. Energy efficiency has now become a first order design parameter and constraint across the entire spectrum of computing devices.Many research surveys have gone into different aspects of energy efficiency techniques implemented in hardware and microarchitecture across devices, servers, HPC/cloud, data center systems along with improved software, algorithms, frameworks, and modeling energy/thermals. Somewhat in parallel, the semiconductor industry has developed techniques and standards around specification, modeling/simulation, benchmarking and verification of complex chips; these areas have not been addressed in detail by previous research surveys. This survey aims to bring these domains holistically together, present the latest in each of these areas, highlight potential gaps and challenges, and discuss opportunities for the next generation of energy efficient systems. The survey is composed of a systematic categorization of key aspects of building energy efficient systems - (1) specification - the ability to precisely specify the power intent, attributes or properties at different layers (2) modeling and simulation of the entire system or subsystem (hardware or software or both) so as to be able to experiment with possible options and perform what-if analysis, (3) techniques used for implementing energy efficiency at different levels of the stack, (4) verification techniques used to provide guarantees that the functionality of complex designs are preserved, and (5) energy efficiency benchmarks, standards and consortiums that aim to standardize different aspects of energy efficiency, including cross-layer optimizations.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.","dynamic power management; Energy efficiency; low power; low power optimizations; modeling; platform-level power management; specification","Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Computer architecture; Computer hardware; Computer software; Computing power; Green computing; Power management; Semiconductor device manufacture; Specifications; Computing system; Dynamic power management; Energy efficient systems; Energy-efficient computing; Low Power; Low-power optimizations; Modeling; Platform-level power management; Research survey; Semiconductor industry; Energy efficiency","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132986500"

However, the evolution of this field has been so fast that a gap has opened in relation to systematic reviews of the relevant literature and the maturation of City Digital Twins on an urban scale. Our work bridges this gap by highlighting maturity in the field. We conducted a systematic literature review with bibliometric and content analysis of 41 selected papers published in Web of Science and Scopus databases, covering five areas: data types and sources, case studies, applied technologies and methods, maturity spectrum, and applications. Based on maturity indicators, the majority of the reviewed studies (90%) were at initial to medium stages of maturity (up to element 3), most of them focused on 3D modelling, monitoring and visualisation. However, digital twins cannot be limited to 3D models, monitoring and visualisation, for they can be developed to include two-directional interactions between humans and computers. Such a high level of maturity, which was not found in the reviewed studies, requires advanced technologies and methods such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, BIM and GIS. We also found that further studies are essential if the field is to handle the complex urban challenges of multidisciplinary digital twins. While City Digital Twins extend by definition beyond mere 3D city modelling, some studies involving 3D city models still refer to their subjects as City Digital Twins. Among the research gaps we identified, we’d like to highlight the need for near-real-time data analytics algorithms, which could furnish City Digital Twins with big data insights. Other opportunities include public participation capabilities to increase social collaboration, integrating BIM and GIS technologies and improving storage and computation infrastructure. © 2023 The Author(s).

In addition, due to its proximity to the user, fog computing proves to be highly efficient in minimizing the volume of data that needs to be transmitted, reducing overall network traffic, and shortening the distance that data must travel. But this technology, like other new technologies, has challenges, and scheduling and optimal allocation of resources is one of the most important of these challenges. Accordingly, this research aims to propose an optimal solution for efficient scheduling within the fog computing environment through the application of the advanced cat swarm optimization algorithm. In this solution, the two main behaviors of cats are implemented in the form of seek and tracking states. Accordingly, processing nodes are periodically examined and categorized based on the number of available resources; servers with highly available resources are prioritized in the scheduling process for efficient scheduling. Subsequently, the congested servers, which may be experiencing various issues, are migrated to alternative servers with ample resources using the virtual machine live migration technique. Ultimately, the effectiveness of the proposed solution is assessed using the iFogSim simulator, demonstrating notable reductions in execution time and energy consumption. So, the proposed solution has led to a 20% reduction in execution time while also improving energy efficiency by more than 15% on average. This optimization represents a trade-off between improving performance and reducing resource consumption. © 2023, Science and Information Organization.

One of the significant contributors to the success of DL is the proliferation of end devices that act as a catalyst to provide data for data-hungry DL models. However, computing DL training and inference still remains the biggest challenge. Moreover, most of the time central cloud servers are used for such computation, thus opening up other significant challenges, such as high latency, increased communication costs, and privacy concerns. To mitigate these drawbacks, considerable efforts have been made to push the processing of DL models to edge servers (a mesh of computing devices near end devices). Recently, the confluence point of DL and edge has given rise to edge intelligence (EI), defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) as the concept where the data is acquired, stored, and processed utilizing edge computing with DL and advanced networking capabilities. Broadly, EI has six levels of categories based on the three locations where the training and inference of DL take place, e.g., cloud server, edge server, and end devices. This survey paper focuses primarily on the fifth level of EI, called all in-edge level, where DL training and inference (deployment) are performed solely by edge servers. All in-edge is suitable when the end devices have low computing resources, e.g., Internet-of-Things, and other requirements such as latency and communication cost are important such as in mission-critical applications (e.g., health care). Besides, 5G/6G networks are envisioned to use all in-edge. Firstly, this paper presents all in-edge computing architectures, including centralized, decentralized, and distributed. Secondly, this paper presents enabling technologies, such as model parallelism, data parallelism, and split learning, which facilitates DL training and deployment at edge servers. Thirdly, model adaptation techniques based on model compression and conditional computation are described because the standard cloud-based DL deployment cannot be directly applied to all in-edge due to its limited computational resources. Fourthly, this paper discusses eleven key performance metrics to evaluate the performance of DL at all in-edge efficiently. Finally, several open research challenges in the area of all in-edge are presented.  © 2013 IEEE.","all in-edge; Artificial intelligence; decentralized systems; deep learning; distributed systems; edge intelligence","Computer architecture; Costs; Deep learning; Edge computing; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Speech recognition; Adaptation models; All in-edge; Cloud-computing; Computational modelling; Decentralized system; Deep learning; Distributed systems; Distributing processing; Edge computing; Edge intelligence; Training data; Image processing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147210326"

However, even though until now automakers have kept up with the innovation pace in terms of the functionalities that have been offered to passengers, the majority of automakers' efforts have concentrated on bringing in these new functionalities by adding an unceasingly larger set of ECUs. All of this has been done without evolving any of the embedded software architecture consequently, due to budgetary constraints, legislative limitations, retro-compatibility problems, and a lack of awareness of the trending IT innovation. This unbalanced progress has then led to a substantial increase in in-vehicle architectural complexity, which has become a major concern for automakers nowadays as it makes the vehicle repairing process more complex, decreases software traceability and clashes with the objective of having higher business flexibility, modularity, and dynamicity within the vehicles. In this paper, we are going to go through literature, both academic and industrial, and propose a comprehensive study into automotive system transformation. We begin by giving a detailed analysis of the causes of evolution under five axes - i.e., society, business, industry, application, and technical. Then, we discuss the convergence of cars and software life cycles and propose a three-layered analysis of automotive ICT systems consisting of architecture design, software pipelines, and run-time management. Finally, we are going to propose certain detailed guidelines on the evolution perspectives for automotive systems through deriving from the convergence of advances in IT, as well as current and future automotive environmental constraints.  © 2013 IEEE.","Automotive ICT system; E/E architecture; software defined vehicles; software pipelines; system architecture; vehicle-to-cloud (V2C)/vehicle-to-anything (V2X)","Budget control; Computer architecture; Computer software; Embedded systems; Pipelines; Software as a service (SaaS); Vehicle performance; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Automotive information and communication technology system; Automotives; Cloud-computing; Convergence; E/E architecture; Information and Communication Technologies; Software defined vehicle; Software pipeline; Software-defined networkings; System analysis and design; Systems architecture; Technological innovation; Technology system; Vehicle-to-cloud (V2C) / vehicle-to-anything (V2X); Life cycle","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164728799"

Elderly people or people with specific needs can benefit from such applications by providing them with an ambient assisted living (AAL). Indoor positioning system (IPS) applications can be deployed under an IoT infrastructure to provide location awareness to other applications, such as AAL solutions. However, software patterns and architectures in the context of IoT applications are still open research topics. This paper proposes a software architecture for IoT-based IPS applications to support AAL systems. We performed a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify solutions and non-functional requirements (NFRs) to incorporate into the architecture of these applications. From the SLR results, we developed an architecture for IoT-based IPS applications, using Fog Computing elements, to support AAL systems. We evaluate the architecture using the iFogSim simulation environment regarding latency, network usage, and energy consumption. The proposed approach was compared to a cloud-based deployment. Experimental results show that the proposed fog-based architecture significantly reduces latency, network usage, and operational costs and is suitable for real-time response scenarios.

The challenge lies in accommodating multiple application microservices with varying Quality of Service (QoS) requirements to share the sensing infrastructure for better resource utilization. In this work, we propose a novel data collection framework, CaDGen (Context-aware Data Generation) for such a shared IoT infrastructure that enables integrated data filtration and forwarding towards minimizing the resource consumption footprint for the IoT infrastructure. The proposed filtration mechanism utilizes the contextual information associated with the running application for determining the relevance of the data. Whereas the proposed forwarding policy aims to satisfy the diverse QoS requirements for the running applications by selecting the suitable next-hop forwarder based on the microservices distribution across different edge devices. A thorough performance evaluation of CaDGen through a testbed implementation as well as a simulation study for diverse setups reveals promising results concerning network resource utilization, scalability, energy conservation, and distribution of computation for optimal service provisioning. It is observed that the CaDGen can achieve nearly 35% reduction in the generated data for a moderately dynamic scenario without compromising on the data quality. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Context-aware; Data collection; Edge computing; Microservice; Sensing","Automation; Data acquisition; Edge computing; Information management; Network security; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Quality of service; Context-Aware; Data collection; Data generation; Data-forwarding; Edge computing; Microservice; Quality-of-service; Running applications; Service requirements; Smart homes; Internet of things","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129245821"

Despite blockchain’s apparent superiority in withstanding a wide range of security threats, a careful examination of the relevant literature reveals that some common pitfalls are associated with these methods. Therefore, the proposed scheme introduces a novel computational security framework wherein a branched and decentralized blockchain network is formulated to facilitate coverage from different variants of side-channel IoT attacks that are yet to be adequately reported. A unique blockchain-based authentication approach is designed to secure communication among mobile IoT devices using multiple stages of security implementation with Smart Agreement and physically unclonable functions. Analytical modeling with lightweight finite field encryption is used to create this framework in Python.

One challenge of using hardware accelerators, including the GPU-based ones, is that their performance is limited by internal and external factors, such as power caps. A common approach to meet the power cap constraint is using the Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS) technique. However, the functionally of this technique is limited and platform-dependent. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new control knob, which is the size of input batches fed to the GPU accelerator in DNN inference applications. We first evaluate the impact of batch size on power consumption and performance of DNN inference. Then, we introduce the design and implementation of a fast and lightweight runtime system, called BatchDVFS. Dynamic batching is implemented in BatchDVFS to adaptively change the batch size, and hence, trade-off throughput with power consumption. It employs an approach based on binary search to find the proper batch size within a short period of time. Combining dynamic batching with the DVFS technique, BatchDVFS can control the power consumption in wider ranges, and hence, yield higher throughput in the presence of power caps. To find near-optimal solution for long-running jobs that can afford a relatively significant profiling overhead, compared with BatchDVFS overhead, we also design an approach, called BOBD, that employs Bayesian Optimization to wisely explore the vast state space resulted by combination of the batch size and DVFS solutions. Conducting several experiments using a modern GPU and several DNN models and input datasets, we show that our BatchDVFS can significantly surpass the techniques solely based on DVFS or batching, regarding throughput (up to 11.2x and 2.2x, respectively), while successfully meeting the power cap.  © 1990-2012 IEEE.","Batch size; Deep neural networks; Dynamic voltage frequency scaling; Gpu accelerator; Power consumption; Throughput","Acceleration; Computer graphics; Computer hardware; Deep neural networks; Dynamic frequency scaling; Economic and social effects; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Graphics processing unit; Program processors; Throughput; Batch sizes; Bayes method; Dynamic voltage; Dynamic voltage frequency scaling; GPU accelerators; Graphic processing unit; Graphics processing; Optimisations; Power demands; Processing units; Resource management; Runtimes; Voltage scaling","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123691967"

Many network applications have been developed in every domain of life, including business, healthcare, smart homes, and smart cities, to name a few. As these network applications provide a wide range of services for large user groups, the network intruders are prone to developing intrusion skills for attack and malicious compliance. Therefore, safeguarding network applications and things connected to the internet has always been a point of interest for researchers. Many studies propose solutions for intrusion detection systems and intrusion prevention systems. Network communities have produced benchmark datasets available for researchers to improve the accuracy of intrusion detection systems. The scientific community has presented data mining and machine learning-based mechanisms to detect intrusion with high classification accuracy. This paper presents an intrusion detection system based on the ensemble of prediction and learning mechanisms to improve anomaly detection accuracy in a network intrusion environment. The learning mechanism is based on automated machine learning, and the prediction model is based on the Kalman filter. Performance analysis of the proposed intrusion detection system is evaluated using publicly available intrusion datasets UNSW-NB15 and CICIDS2017. The proposed model-based intrusion detection accuracy for the UNSW-NB15 dataset is 98.801 percent, and the CICIDS2017 dataset is 97.02 percent.

To counter these automation related issues, autonomic computing (AC) emerges as a potential solution to optimize the performance of cloud computing. The merge of these two prominent technologies gives rise to a new technological domain called autonomic cloud computing (ACC).

Features based solutions are further classified into management (of services, workload, and resources) and security aware solutions. Similarly, parameters based solutions are grouped into quality-of-service aware and performance management solutions. Finally, the comparative analysis of state-of-the-art ACC approaches with respect to the approach referred, performance metrics, outcome, and the derived inference is also presented to have an in-depth understanding of the existing literature.

Various intelligent sensors play a central role, as they generate a vast amount of real-time data that can provide insights into manufacturing. Complex event processing (CEP) and machine learning (ML) have been developed actively in the last years in IIoT to identify patterns in heterogeneous data streams and fuse raw data into tangible facts. In a traditional compute-centric paradigm, the raw field data are continuously sent to the cloud and processed centrally. As IIoT devices become increasingly pervasive, concerns are raised since transmitting such an amount of data is energy-intensive, vulnerable to be intercepted, and subjected to high latency. Decentralized on-device ML and CEP provide a solution where data is processed primarily on edge devices. Thus communications can be minimized. However, this is no mean feat because most IIoT edge devices are resource-constrained with low power consumption. This paper proposes a framework that exploits ML and CEP's synergy at the edge in distributed sensor networks. By leveraging tiny ML and μCEP, we now shift the computation from the cloud to the resource-constrained IIoT devices and allow users to adapt on-device ML models and CEP reasoning rules flexibly on the fly. Lastly, we demonstrate the proposed solution and show its effectiveness and feasibility using an industrial use case of machine safety monitoring.  © 2021 ACM.","complex event processing; industrial IoT; tiny machine learning","Accident prevention; Complex networks; Data streams; Machine learning; Sensor networks; Software architecture; Complex event processing; Complex event processing (CEP); Distributed sensor networks; Heterogeneous data; Industrial use case; Intelligent sensors; Low-power consumption; Reasoning rules; Industrial internet of things (IIoT)","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110363740"

The pervasiveness of the new essential service models is expanding, and includes self-driving cars, smart homes, smart cities, as well as promoting the development of some traditional fields such as agriculture, healthcare, and transportation; the development of IoT devices has not shown any sign of cooling down. On the one hand, several studies are coming up with many scenarios for IoT platforms, but some critical issues related to performance, speed, power consumption, availability, security, and scalability are not yet fully resolved. On the other hand, IoT devices are manufactured and developed by different organizations and individuals; hence, there is no unified standard (uniformity of IoT devices), i.e., sending and receiving messages among them and between them and the upper layer (e.g., edge devices). To address these issues, this paper proposes an IoT Platform called BMDD (Broker-less and Microservice architecture, Decentralized identity, and Dynamic transmission messages) that has a combination of two architectural models, including broker-less and microservices, with cutting-edge technologies such as decentralized identity and dynamic message transmission. The main contributions of this article are five-fold, including: (i) proposing broker-less and microservice for the IoT platform which can reduce single failure point of brokering architecture, easy to scale out and improve failover; (ii) providing a decentralized authentication mechanism which is suitable for IoT devices attribute (i.e., mobility, distributed); (iii) applying the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model for the authorization process; (iv) exploiting the gRPC protocol combined with the Kafka message queue enhances transmission rates, transmission reliability, and reduces power consumption in comparison with MQTT protocol; and (v) developing a dynamic message transmission mechanism that helps users communicate with any device, regardless of the manufacturer, since it provides very high homogeneity. © Copyright 2022 Nguyen et al.","Broker-less architecture; Decentralized identity; Dynamic message; gRPC protocol; Internet of Things; IoT platform; Kafka message queue; Microservice architecture; Role-based access control","Authentication; Automation; Automotive industry; Electric power utilization; Intelligent buildings; Internet protocols; Memory architecture; Network architecture; Broker-less; Broker-less architecture; Decentralised; Decentralized identity; Dynamic message; GRPC protocol; Internet of thing platform; Kafkum message queue; Message queues; Microservice architecture; Role-based Access Control; Internet of things","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131087186"

The requirement of supporting both latency-sensitive and compute-intensive IoT tasks necessitates service resilience, especially for the broker nodes in typical broker-worker deployment designs. Existing fault-tolerance or resilience schemes often lack robustness and generalization capability in non-stationary workload settings. This is typically due to the expensive periodic fine-tuning of models required to adapt them in dynamic scenarios. To address this, we present a confidence aware resilience model, CAROL, that utilizes a memory-efficient generative neural network to predict the Quality of Service (QoS) for a future state and a confidence score for each prediction. Thus, whenever a broker fails, we quickly recover the system by executing a local-search over the broker-worker topology space and optimize future QoS. The confidence score enables us to keep track of the prediction performance and run parsimonious neural network fine-tuning to avoid excessive overheads, further improving the QoS of the system. Experiments on a Raspberry-Pi based edge testbed with IoT benchmark applications show that CAROL outperforms state-of-the-art resilience schemes by reducing the energy consumption, deadline violation rates and resilience overheads by up to 16, 17 and 36 percent, respectively.  © 2022 IEEE.","Confidence-Aware; Deep Learning; Edge Federations; Generative Models; Service Resilience","Benchmarking; Deep learning; Energy utilization; Fault tolerance; Forecasting; Internet of things; Confidence-aware; Deep learning; Edge federation; Fine tuning; Generative model; Neural-networks; Quality-of-service; Resilience model; Service resiliences; Workers'; Quality of service","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130856063"

Although progress has been made to study containerization, systematic consolidation of the existing literature with a summative evaluation is still missing.

To meet the diverse requirements of the emerging applications, the concept of digital twins has been recently proposed. A digital twin uses a virtual representation along with security-related technologies (e.g., blockchain), communication technologies (e.g., 6G), computing technologies (e.g., edge computing), and machine learning, so as to enable the smart applications. In this tutorial, we present a comprehensive overview on digital twins for wireless systems. First, we present the fundamental concepts (i.e., design aspects, high-level architecture, and frameworks) of digital twins for wireless systems. Second, a comprehensive taxonomy is devised for two aspects, namely, twins for wireless and wireless for twins. For the twins for wireless aspect, we consider issues related to design of twin objects, physical devices, and interface, as well as prototyping, deployment trends, incentive mechanism, isolation of twins, and decoupling. For the wireless for twins aspect, we consider issues related to accessing twin objects, security and privacy, and air interface design are considered.

To fulfil the low latency requirements of beyond fifth-generation (B5G)-IoT applications and provide quality of service (QoS) to IoT-edge communication, it is important to minimize server delay. Furthermore, 5G-IoT systems consume more power than their predecessors, which is a concern given the growing size of future IoT networks. This research presents a hybrid latency and power-aware approach for B5G-IoT networks (HLPA B5G-IoT) that minimizes latency with minimum overhead on battery-constrained IoT nodes while simultaneously providing a power-efficient solution for B5G-IoT-edge networks. HLPA B5G-IoT has a novel algorithm classifier tool (ACT) for selecting appropriate optimization algorithms based on the characteristics and requirements of B5G-IoT systems. The ACT matrix not only parametrically compares HLPA B5G-IoT with existing approaches but also identifies crucial parameters that enable algorithm selection for load balancing and energy efficiency. In this paper, metaheuristic algorithms, i.e., biogeography-based optimization (BBO) and grey wolf optimization (GWO), are tailored to meet the requirements of load balancing and power efficiency in IoT-edge systems. The proposed load-balancing algorithm reduces latency and improves overall network performance by 33.33%, 27.45%, 23.52%, 21.56%, 13.72%, 11.76%, and 7.84% compared with simulated annealing (SA), genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), bacteria foraging algorithm (BFA), ant colony optimization (ACO), bat algorithm (BA), and genetic SA PSO (GSP), respectively.

Microservice architecture, because of the service component and other related characteristics, using this architecture can build a high availability and low coupling application system, which effectively improves the service quality of the system, and therefore the microservice architecture has gradually become the flow software development architecture. Based on the research of infrastructure digitization and integration of construction and maintenance, this paper proposes the concept of infrastructure intelligent service system (is3) from the perspective of information flow, so as to realize the intelligent management of infrastructure. This paper is based on the system requirements analysis. The intelligent service system of infrastructure with microservice architecture is designed, and its performance is tested through experiment. The test results show that in the brain high development test, the designed service reached no error, and the average response day was stable below 27 ms; in the continuous high concurrent test, the average response time of the designed service side remained within 100 ms when the concurrency is 12000, and no request occurred during the test.  © 2022 Yanyan Lv and Wenken Tan.","","Application programs; Architectural design; Computer architecture; Informatization; Requirements engineering; Software design; Building Information Modelling; Cloud-computing; Development trends; Engineering information; Informatization; Intelligent management; Intelligent service systems; Service components; Service systems; Smart services; Information management","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134427586"

Exploiting these advantages requires new and specialized designs for management, automation, and orchestration systems which are capable of reliably operating and handling new elements such as virtual functions, virtualized infrastructures, and a whole new set of relationships among them. Operations such as resource allocation, instantiation, monitoring, scaling, or termination of virtual functions are key lifecycle operations that NFV management and orchestration (NFV-MANO) frameworks need to correctly perform. Failures of the NFV-MANO prevent the network ability to respond to new service requests or events related to the normal lifecycle operation of network services. Thus, it is important to ensure robustness and high availability of the MANO framework. This paper adopts a model-driven approach to predict the availability of the NFV-MANO and assess the impact that different failure modes have. We propose different models, based on Stochastic Activity Networks (SANs), which abstract various MANO deployment configurations, inspired by current containerized open-source MANO implementations. Moreover, we integrate software rejuvenation and investigate the trade-off between its associated overhead and system availability increase. An extensive experimental campaign with fault-injection techniques on a real-life MANO implementation allows to derive a number of realistic recovery parameters. The case studies are used to quantitatively evaluate the steady-state availability and identify the most important parameters influencing system availability for the different deployment configurations.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","availability; containers; NFV-MANO; SAN models; software aging; software rejuvenation","Availability; Economic and social effects; Endocrinology; Life cycle; Open source software; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Availability assessment; Experimental campaign; Fault Injection techniques; Model driven approach; Recovery parameters; Software rejuvenation; Steady-state availability; Stochastic activity networks; Network function virtualization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112213819"

However, there is still a cost for usage when the server is inactive or having low to no traffic at all. Serverless deployment offer function as a service where application is deployed as a function and cost is billed per function call. This paper proposed a solution where there are two deployment that works in turn between infrastructure as a service and function as a service deployment. This dual deployment offered the system to use the virtual private server or deployed instance on active hours, and switch to serverless functions on inactive hours. Switching to serverless on low traffic hours will cut the usage and cost of the microservice app by the least 25%, while having performance slightly comparable to microservice app deployed to instances. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

In recent years, various literature had been published in these research areas to propose different models, architectures, and contributions in the domains. Due to the importance of efficient data collection regarding reducing energy consumption, latency, network lifetime, and general cost, a momentous literature volume has been published to facilitate data collection. Hence, review studies have been conducted on data collection in these domains in isolation. However, a lack of comprehensive review collectively identifies and analyzes the differences and similarities among the data collection proposals in IoT, WSN, and SC. The main objective of this research is to conduct a comprehensive survey to explore the current state, use cases, contributions, performance measures, evaluation measures, and architecture in the IoT, WSN, and SC research domains. The findings indicate that studies on data collection in IoT, WSN, and SC are relatively consistent with stable output in the last five years. Nine novel contributions are found with models, algorithms, and frameworks being the most utilized by the selected studies.

Industry 4.0 is becoming recognised as a unique industrial paradigm. It is predicated on the widespread adoption of communication and information technology, which would lead to improved organisational performance and flexibility. The incorporation of Industry 4.0 is the true game-changer in terms of flexibility and customisation. Manufacturers may utilise this technology to build digital twins of items used by consumers in the real world. The digital twin gets real-time information from sensors on the actual objects. Manufacturers benefit from digital twin and simulation technology, including predictive maintenance and making errors easier and faster to rectify.

Different dimensions and technologies of Industry 4.0 Practices for improving FMS performance are studied,d and then discusses several flexible approaches using Industry 4.0 technologies are. One of the most significant benefits of adopting virtual infrastructure maintained by a service provider is improved flexibility. Cloud services allow auto-scaling, which means that the underlying computer resources automatically adjust to changing utilisation rates. Industry 4.0 increases production flexibility, allowing a facility to respond to market changes quickly.

An important issue related to finding the desired outcomes remains unexplored, i.e., how to determine key insights from the sparse academic literature in the age of digital publishing. To mitigate the issue, this study proposes a novel strategy to systematically survey the relevant studies by converting the sparse literature into visual presentations. We first apply a systematic approach called a PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses) statement to provide the insights from the published literature of the past decade (2010–2020). Then, VOSviewer experiments are conducted to transform these sparse scholarly data into visual representations. In total, eighty-one papers published in high-impact journals are identified based on their scientific soundness and relevance, and a VOSviewer analysis is applied. The analysis revealed the existence of three research clusters focused on the following main thematic areas: the energy management in smart homes and smart grids (35 journal papers); the emerging concept of context-awareness (26 journal papers); and the role of privacy preservation in IEMSs (20 journal papers). This analysis uncovers the current state of IEMSs and explores existing issues, methods, findings, and gaps. Thus, future research directions have been recommended to fill the existing gaps. This systematic literature review is to assist both researchers and industry practitioners to understand the research gaps of previous studies. © 2021","Intelligent energy management systems; Systematic literature review (SLR); VOS viewer experiments","Automation; Energy management systems; Energy resources; Intelligent buildings; Paper; Publishing; 'current; Academic literature; Digital publishing; Energy; Intelligent energy management; Intelligent energy management systems; Journal paper; New solutions; Systematic literature review; VOS viewer experiment; Energy management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108995250"

In the interest of programmer productivity and ease of scaling, workloads in data centers have shifted from single monolithic processes toward a micro and nanoservice software architecture. As a result, single servers are now packed with many threads executing the same, relatively small task on different data.State-of-the-art data centers run these microservices on multi-core CPUs. However, the flexibility offered by traditional CPUs comes at an energy-efficiency cost. The Multiple Instruction Multiple Data execution model misses opportunities to aggregate the similarity in contemporary microservices. We observe that the Single Instruction Multiple Thread execution model, employed by GPUs, provides better thread scaling and has the potential to reduce frontend and memory system energy consumption. However, contemporary GPUs are ill-suited for the latency-sensitive microservice space.To exploit the similarity in contemporary microservices, while maintaining acceptable latency, we propose the Request Processing Unit (RPU). The RPU combines elements of out-of-order CPUs with lockstep thread aggregation mechanisms found in GPUs to execute microservices in a Single Instruction Multiple Request (SIMR) fashion.

The promise when using FaaS is that users only have to focus on the core business functionality in form of cloud functions. However, a few configuration options remain within the developer's responsibility. Most of the currently available cloud function offerings force the user to choose a memory or other resource setting and a timeout value. CPU is scaled based on the chosen options. At a first glance, this seems like an easy task, but the tradeoff between performance and cost has implications on the quality of service of a cloud function. Therefore, in this paper we present a local simulation approach for cloud functions and support developers in choosing a suitable configuration. The methodology we propose simulates the execution behavior of cloud functions locally, makes the cloud and local environment comparable and maps the local profiling data to a cloud platform. This reduces time during the development and enables developers to work with their familiar tools. This is especially helpful when implementing multi-Threaded cloud functions.  © 2021 IEEE.","Benchmarking; FaaS; Function as a Service; Profiling; Serverless; Simulation","Configuration options; Core business; Function as a service; Performance; Profiling; Quality-of-service; Serverless; Simulation; Simulation approach; Quality of service","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119334596"

The key advantage of such systems is that the runtime or dynamic code migration between the components across the whole system becomes more flexible, increasing compatibility and improving resource allocation in networks. Despite the apparent advantages of such an approach, there are multiple issues and challenges to overcome before a truly valid solution can be built. In this idea paper, we propose an architecture for isomorphic microservice deployment on heterogeneous hardware assets, inspired by previous ideas introduced as liquid software [12].

Common challenges comprise correctness, performance, and forensics analysis after a system crash. The challenges are aggravated when both edge and fog devices get in the picture, since the limited resources of some of them exacerbate any possible issue, and create the need for a robust mechanism to collect log data to make sense of the system's behavior. The envisioned monitoring layer should collect log data regarding performance and errors, protect the data until they are delivered to an external data processing facility, and be easy to integrate into the deployed system. This paper proposes C-Mon, a resilience-focused monitoring framework for service-oriented applications that tests timing constraints against live log data. The monitoring framework is integrated with OpenAPI Generator, the mainstream ReST code generator we used to generate client and server interfaces and monitoring mechanisms.

IoT is quite helpful in uplifting living standards by transforming conventional technology into smart systems. Greenhouse production is considered as an ultimate solution for rising global food demands with the growing population. Greenhouse provides a year-round production facility for fresh vegetables with around 50% increased production rate in comparison to open-air cultivation. However, energy consumption and labor cost in greenhouses account for more than 50% of the cost of greenhouse production. In this paper, we have proposed a novel optimization scheme that aims to achieve a trade-off between energy consumption and desired climate setting in greenhouse i.e. temperature, CO 2 level, and humidity. For performance evaluation of the proposed system, we have developed an ad-hoc emulator of the greenhouse environment. For the proposed model validation and experimental analysis, we have used 15 days of external environmental data collected in Jeju, South Korea. Proposed optimization scheme results are compared with a baseline scheme. Comparative analysis of experimental results shows that our proposed model maintains desired indoor environment for maximizing crop production with 26.56% reduced energy consumption than the baseline scheme. Furthermore proposed model achieve a 27.76% cost reduction when compared to the baseline scheme. Better optimization results of the proposed scheme give us the confidence to further investigate its effectiveness in a real environment for achieving improved energy efficiency. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Energy efficiency; IoT; Optimization; Smart greenhouse","Cost reduction; Cultivation; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Greenhouses; Wages; Comparative analysis; Environmental data; Experimental analysis; Greenhouse environment; Greenhouse production; Internet of Things (IOT); Optimization scheme; Production facility; Internet of things","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107726562"

Goal: We aim at (i) unveiling the state-of-the-practice in terms of targeted quality attributes and architecture documentation in ROS-based systems, and (ii) providing empirically-grounded guidance to roboticists about how to properly architect ROS-based systems. Methods: We designed and conducted an observational study where we (i) built a dataset of 335 GitHub repositories containing real open-source ROS-based systems, and (ii) mined the repositories to extract and synthesize quantitative and qualitative findings about how roboticists are architecting ROS-based systems. Results: First, we extracted an empirically-grounded overview of the state of the practice for architecting and documenting ROS-based systems. Second, we synthesized a catalog of 47 architecting guidelines for ROS-based systems. Third, the extracted guidelines were validated by 119 roboticists working on real-world open-source ROS-based systems. Conclusion: Roboticists can use our architecting guidelines for applying good design principles to develop robots that meet quality requirements, and researchers can use our results as evidence-based indications about how real-world ROS systems are architected today, thus inspiring future research contributions. © 2021 The Author(s)","Robotics; ROS; Software architecture","Machine design; Open source software; Robotics; Robots; Architecture practice; De facto standard; Evidence-based; Observational study; Quality attributes; Quality requirements; Robot operating systems (ROS); State of the practice; Open systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105348947"

The proposed method of ePDR-BLE compensation mechanism (EPBCM) takes advantage of the non-requirement of linearization of the system around its current state in an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and Kalman filter (KF) in smoothing of received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values. In this paper, a fusion of conflicting information and the activity detection approach of an object in an indoor environment contemplates varying magnitude of accelerometer values based on the hidden Markov model (HMM). On the estimated orientation, the proposed approach remunerates the inadvertent body acceleration and magnetic distortion sensor data. Moreover, EPBCM can precisely calculate the velocity and position by reducing the position drift, which gives rise to a fault in zero-velocity and heading error. The developed EPBCM localization algorithm using Bluetooth low energy beacons (BLE) was applied and analyzed in an indoor environment. The experiments conducted in an indoor scenario shows the results of various activities performed by the object and achieves better orientation estimation, zero velocity measurements, and high position accuracy than other methods in the literature. © 2021 by the authors.

Analysis for continuous improvement of a production system requires a set of data (machine uptime, downtime, cycle-time) that are not typically monitored by a conventional fault monitoring system. Although productivity improvement is a critical aspect for a manufacturing site, not many production systems are equipped with a dedicated data recording system towards continuous improvement.

A major factor in efficient operations is the underlying software that controls the networking hardware or virtualized network functions. Most software in hardware-based networking devices is periodically updated, which may or may not have impact on various aspects of the performance of the device. We consider the issue of change point detection in network performance indicators, aiming to detect when such software updates co-occur with changes to any subset of collected performance metrics. In particular, we study the change point detection problem that arises when the placement in time of firmware changes is known a priori, but the presence of any performance implications is unknown. We focus on evaluating change point detection in operational network equipment log data, and consider diurnal variation suppression approaches. We propose the use of periodicity filtering to remove anomalous data sources, and apply a resampling technique using bootstrapping to determine when a software update has performance implications. Our results show that this automated change point detection approach can locate performance-related changes, and that load normalization appears to be the most sensitive approach to diurnal variation suppression. © 2022 IEEE.","bootstrapping; NFV; periodogram; SDN","Change detection; Energy utilization; Network function virtualization; Bootstrapping; Change point detection; Change-points; Diurnal variation; Networking systems; NFV; Performance; Periodograms; SDN; Software updates; Firmware","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133170314"

The set of those DTCs structure the “patient_digital_twin” cluster in which appropriate pipelines define and monitor in real time the “best” possible construction of the patient’s digital twin. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Containers; Digital twin; Electronic health records; Healthcare; Machine learning; Microservices; MLOps","E-learning; Engineering education; Health care; Life cycle; Machine learning; Records management; Electronic health; Electronic health record; Health records; Healthcare; Holistic approach; Machine learning operation; Machine-learning; Microservice; Specific problems; Containers","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135001872"

These applications are distributed in nature and installed on mobile and servers to achieve many business goals. With this motivation, mobile edge computing (MEC) is an evolving paradigm that reduces the energy consumption of mobile devices through the offload process. However, currently all studies only concentrated on mobile energy and widely overlooked the energy usage of the computing node resources and application deadlines during offloading and scheduling in the MEC network. This research suggests a new mobile edge cloud (mob-cloud) architecture that minimises the nodes energy and meets the deadline requirements of applications. This research formulates this problem as the convex optimisation problem under linear integer programming. The mob-cloud consists of different types of virtual machines which are implementing at the edge computing. This study introduces a novel deadline and energy-efficient task scheduling (DEETS) algorithm framework consisting of task sequencing, resource searching, and mobility-aware scheduling. Furthermore, DEETS keeps tradeoff performances between resource energy usage and task deadline. Simulation results show that the proposed DEETS outperformed all contemporary methods regarding energy usage and deadlines of applications by 50%. © 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","deadline and energy-efficient task scheduling; DEETS; MEC; mob-cloud architecture; mobile edge computing; slack time; task scheduling","Computer architecture; Convex optimization; Energy utilization; Green computing; Integer programming; Internet of things; Mobile edge computing; Multitasking; Network architecture; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Cloud architectures; Deadline and energy-efficient task scheduling; Deadline-aware; Edge clouds; Energy efficient; Energy usage; Mobile edge cloud architecture; Slack time; Energy efficiency","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128730456"

Additionally, it is necessary to have a feedback report to detect the behavior of drivers and what to do differently to improve driving.

Unfortunately, traditional sched-ulers, working at millisecond scale and characterized by strict priority schemes, are no longer suitable to meet increasingly stringent and diverse requirements imposed by many workloads. Recognizing this aspect, the research community has recently proposed new schedulers operating at microsecond granularity. This work studies microsecond-scale schedulers and policies for data center applications from the configuration versus perfor-mance standpoint. We demonstrate that for the best performance, workload-dependent parameter tuning is fundamental. Specifically, even a slight misconfiguration can also lead to 110% higher tail latency with respect to its best-case scenario.

Hence, industrial requirements are not commonly addressed, and there is no guiding methodology for their implementation in real PdM use-cases.

One such capability is well-being, a composition of multiple atomic capabilities that characterize a smart building. Atomic functions that compose a well-being capability include temperature, noise level, pollution level, and humidity, to name a few. Multiple efforts have addressed this specific capability and its composition requirements and techniques from standardization, technical, and quality of service aspects. One such effort is the IoT and CPS Composition Framework (ICCF), a novel framework for rapid modeling, specifying, verifying, and prototyping IoT and CPS capabilities. ICCF relies on the NIST CPS Framework guidelines to address different stakeholders' concerns; it also leverages composition semantics inspired by the mPlane platform to describe entities and interactions intuitively. In addition, it uses the Temporal Logic of Actions + (TLA+) formal verification techniques to verify the correctness of core functions. This work leverages the ICCF framework to provide the following contributions: i) description of a stakeholder-defined well-being composition capability based on the ICCF framework foundations, ii) an in-depth characterization of the well-being capability, iii) considerations regarding the formal aspects of the well-being capability, including verifying its correctness, deadlock, and state-space, iv) implementation of the composite capability using a lightweight microservices environment, v) discussion of results based on the different domains of interest including residential buildings and factories.

The existing frameworks worked well, but these suffered the problems such as overhead, resource utilization, lengthy boot-time, and cost of running Mobile Applications. This study addresses these problems by proposing a Dynamic Decision-Based Task Scheduling Technique for Microservice-based Mobile Cloud Computing Applications (MSCMCC). The MSCMCC runs delay-sensitive applications and mobility with less cost than existing approaches. The study focused on Task Scheduling problems on heterogeneous Mobile Cloud servers.

Current personalized healthcare services are dedicated in a specific environment to support technological personalization (e.g., personalized gadgets/devices). However, they are unable to consider different inter-related health conditions, leading to inappropriate diagnosis and affect sustainability and the long-term health/life of patients.

In particular, we first present an overview of key requirements of comprehensive personalized healthcare services (CPHS) in modern healthcare Internet of Things (HIoT), including the definition of personalization and an example use case scenario as a representative for modern HIoT. Second, we explored a fundamental three-layer architecture for IoT-based healthcare systems using both AI and non-AI-based approaches, considering key requirements for CPHS followed by their strengths and weaknesses in the frame of personalized healthcare services. Third, we highlighted different security threats against each layer of IoT architecture along with the possible AI and non-AI-based solutions.

However, research and development in this field are hindered because there is a lack of a framework that can be easily extended to collect various types of monitoring data from the WiFi stack. In this paper, we propose FLIP, a framework for leveraging eBPF to augment WiFi access points and investigate the performance of WiFi networks. Using this framework, we focus on two important aspects of monitoring the WiFi stack. First, considering the high delay experienced by packets at access points, we show how switching packets from the wired interface to the wireless interface can be monitored and timestamped accurately at each step. We build a testbed using FLIP access points and investigate the factors affecting packet delay experienced in access points. Second, we present a novel approach that allows access points to track the duty-cycling pattern and energy consumption of their associated stations accurately and without the need for any external energy measurement tools. We validate the high energy measurement accuracy of FLIP by empirical experiments and comparisons against a commercial tool.  © 2021 ACM.","802.11; delay; duty cycle; energy; monitoring; packet switching","IEEE Standards; Packet networks; Packet switching; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); 802.11; Access points; Delay; Duty-cycle; Energy; Gain insight; Network dynamics; Network operations; Wi Fi networks; Wi-fi access points; Energy utilization","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121435592"

In this paper, we propose Jellyfish-a novel edge DL inference serving system that achieves soft guarantees on end-to-end inference latency often specified as a service-level objective (SLO). To handle the network variability, Jellyfish exploits both data and deep neural network (DNN) adaptation to conduct tradeoffs between accuracy and latency. Jellyfish features a new design that enables collective adaptation policies where the decisions for data and DNN adaptations are aligned and coordinated among multiple users with varying network conditions. We propose efficient algorithms to dynamically adapt DNNs and map users, so that we fulfill latency SLOs while maximizing the overall inference accuracy.

Design/methodology/approach: Load balancing is a key problem in any distributed environment such as cloud and IoT. It is useful when a few nodes are overloaded, a few are under-loaded and the remainders are idle without interrupting the functioning. As this problem is known as an NP-hard one and SSO is a powerful meta-hybrid method that inspires shark hunting behavior and their skill to detect and feel the smell of the bait even from far away, in this research, this study have provided a new method to solve this problem using the SSO algorithm. Also, the study have synthesized the fuzzy logic to counterbalance the load distribution. Furthermore, DVFS, as a powerful energy management method, is used to reduce the energy consumption of integrated circuits of IoT nodes such as processor and circuit bus by reducing the frequency. Findings: The outcomes of the simulation have indicated that the proposed method has outperformed the hybrid ant colony optimization – particle swarm optimization and PSO regarding energy consumption. Similarly, it has enhanced the load balance better than the moth flame optimization approach and task execution node assignment algorithm. Research limitations/implications: There are many aspects and features of IoT load-balancing that are beyond the scope of this paper. Also, given that the environment was considered static, future research can be in a dynamic environment. Practical implications: The introduced method is useful for improving the performance of IoT-based applications. We can use these systems to jointly and collaboratively check, handle and control the networks in real-time. Also, the platform can be applied to monitor and control various IoT applications in manufacturing environments such as transportation systems, automated work cells, storage systems and logistics. Originality/value: This study have proposed a novel load balancing technique for decreasing energy consumption using the SSO algorithm and fuzzy logic. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Dynamic voltage; Energy consumption; Frequency scaling; Integrated circuits; Internet of things; Load balancing; Shark smell optimization","Ant colony optimization; Computer circuits; Dynamic frequency scaling; Energy utilization; Flame hardening; Fuzzy logic; NP-hard; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Real time systems; Voltage scaling; Design/methodology/approach; Distributed environments; Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling; Hybrid ant colony optimization; Internet of Things (IOT); Load balancing technique; Manufacturing environments; Optimization algorithms; Internet of things","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092748225"

As a potential solution, mobile edge computing (MEC) deploys cloud resources in the proximity of IoT devices so that their requests can be better served locally. In this work, we investigate computation offloading in a dynamic MEC system with multiple edge servers, where computational tasks with various requirements are dynamically generated by IoT devices and offloaded to MEC servers in a time-varying operating environment (e.g., channel condition changes over time). The objective of this work is to maximize the completed tasks before their respective deadlines and minimize energy consumption. To this end, we propose an end-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to select the best edge server for offloading and allocate the optimal computational resource such that the expected long-term utility is maximized.

As the population of cities grows and their environmental impact becomes more evident, the European strategy aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions—the main cause of climate change. Measures to reduce the impact of climate change include reducing energy consumption, improving mobility, harnessing resources and renewable energies, integrating nature-based solutions and efficiently managing infrastructure. The monitoring and control of all this activity is essential for its proper functioning. In this context, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) plays a key role in the digitisation, monitoring, and managing of these different verticals. Urban data platforms support cities on extracting Key Performance Indicators (KPI) in their efforts to make better decisions. Cities must be transformed by applying efficient urban planning measures and taking into account not only technological aspects, but also by applying a holistic vision in building solutions where citizens are at the centre. In addition, standardisation of platforms where applications are integrated as one is necessary. This requires interoperability between different verticals. This article presents the information platform developed for the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz in Spain. The platform is based on the UNE 178104 standard to provide a holistic architecture that integrates information from the different urban planning measures implemented in the city. The platform was constructed in the context of the SmartEnCity project following the urban transformation strategy established by the city. The article presents the value-added solutions implemented in the platform. These solutions have been developed by applying co-creation techniques in which stakeholders have been involved throughout the process. The platform proposes a step forward towards standardization, harmonises the integration of data from multiple vertical, provides interoperability between services, and simplifies scalability and replicability due to its microservice architecture. © 2021 by the authors.

Containerisation simplifies management and support of the cloud infrastructure and applications. Clouds typically are consumed in a pay-as-you-go pricing model. However, when applied to containerised environments, such traditional models do not consider resource utilisation values, leading to inaccurate estimates. Moreover, these models do not consider energy consumption, a dominant component of the data centre’s total cost of ownership. This paper proposes Energy Price Cloud Containers (EPCC), a cost model based on energy consumption that accounts for containers’ effective resource utilisation. We compare EPCC with AWS Fargate to highlight the benefits of using an energy-based pricing model. Thus, by comparing the cost of an application running using AWS Fargate with the estimated cost of that application in nome, it is possible to identify the benefits of using an energy-based pricing model. The weekly costs estimated when running computational resources at nome vary between US$ 2.31 and US$ 10.59.

Edge computing nodes (ECNs), experience less transmission latency and usually save on energy while network overheads are mitigated. The ECNs can be fixed or mobile in their positions. We will focus on mobile ECNs in this survey. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on mobile ECNs and identifies some open research questions. In particular, mobile ECNs are classified into four categories, namely aerial, ground vehicular, spatial, and maritime nodes. For each specific group, any mutual basic terms used in the state-of-the-art are described, different types of nodes employed in the group are reviewed, the general network architecture is introduced, the existing methods and algorithms are studied, and the challenges that the group is scrimmaging against are explored. Moreover, the integrated architectures are surveyed, wherein two different categories of the aforementioned nodes jointly play the role of ECNs in the network. Finally, the research gaps, that are yet to be filled in the area of mobile ECNs, are discussed along with directions for future research and investigation in this promising area.  © 1998-2012 IEEE.","aerial nodes; applications; architectures; challenges; ground vehicular nodes; maritime vessels; Mobile edge computing nodes; spatial nodes","Antennas; Internet of things; Job analysis; Mobile edge computing; Network architecture; Surveys; Aerial node; Challenge; Cloud-computing; Computing nodes; Delay; Edge computing; Ground vehicular node; Maritime vessels; Mobile edge computing node; Spatial nodes; Task analysis; Computer architecture","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139840321"

In addition, the stages of telecommunication development are conventionally divided from manual switching to flexible virtualized architecture, to which telecommunications operators have resorted. Furthermore, in the context of the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) standards framework, the network function virtualization (NFV) with might and main has been evaluated by telecom operators and shows that the efficiency of the topology can be significantly improved. However, it is difficult to organize ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) and massive machine type communications (mMTC) services within 5G, due to the topology centralization. Moreover, network monitoring, in particular of carrier-class equipment, reveals that there is no ideal static network topology in which the network and its elements have been uniformly loaded over a long service time. Therefore, in this study, a dynamic network topology and service placement is proposed to analyze and predict services, in which Genetic Algorithm (GA) is utilized. In addition, an efficient forecasting and live migration methods of service as an application to edge computing systems are introduced, where this approach can be used in the systems with an intelligent allocation of operator equipment resources for providing flexibility and high-quality topological organization.

Among other features, edge computing offers extremely low client/server latencies. To consistently provide such low latencies, services should run on edge nodes that are physically as close as possible to their clients. Thus, when the physical location of a client changes, a service should migrate between edge nodes to maintain proximity. Differently from cloud nodes, edge nodes integrate CPUs of different Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs), hence a program natively compiled for a given ISA cannot migrate to a server equipped with a CPU of a different ISA. This hinders migration to the closest node. We introduce H-Container, a system that migrates natively compiled containerized applications across compute nodes featuring CPUs of different ISAs. H-Container advances over existing heterogeneous-ISA migration systems by being (a) highly compatible - no user's source-code nor compiler toolchain modifications are needed; (b) easily deployable - fully implemented in user space, thus without any OS or hypervisor dependency, and (c) largely Linux-compliant - it can migrate most Linux software, including server applications and dynamically linked binaries. H-Container targets Linux and its already-compiled executables, adopts LLVM, extends CRIU, and integrates with Docker. Experiments demonstrate that H-Container adds no overheads during program execution, while 10-100 ms are added during migration. Furthermore, we show the benefits of H-Container in real-world scenarios, demonstrating, for example, up to 94% increase in Redis throughput when client/server proximity is maintained through heterogeneous container migration. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.","containers; Edge; heterogeneous ISA; migration","Application programs; C (programming language); Computer architecture; Edge computing; Linux; Program compilers; Client /server; Cloud services; Computing paradigm; Edge; Edge computing; Edge nodes; Heterogeneous instruction set architecture; Instruction set architecture; Low latency; Migration; Containers","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133870426"

Existing CPU power-saving techniques degrade the performance of these applications due to the long transition latency (order of 100μs) to wake up from a deep CPU idle state (C-state). For this reason, server vendors recommend only enabling shallow core C-states (e.g., CC1) for idle CPU cores, thus preventing the system from entering deep package C-states (e.g., PC6) when all CPU cores are idle. This choice, however, impairs server energy proportionality since power-hungry resources (e.g., IOs, uncore, DRAM) remain active even when there is no active core to use them. As we show, it is common for all cores to be idle due to the low average utilization (e.g., 5-20%) of datacenter servers running user-facing applications. We propose to reap this opportunity with AgilePkgC (APC), a new package C-state architecture that improves the energy proportionality of server processors running latency-critical applications. APC implements PC 1A (package C l agile), a new deep package C-state that a system can enter once all cores are in a shallow C-state (i.e., CC1) and has a nanosecond-scale transition latency. PC 1A is based on four key techniques. First, a hardware-based agile power management unit (APMU) rapidly detects when all cores enter a shallow core C-state (CC1) and triggers the system-level power savings control flow. Second, an IO Standby Mode (IOSM) places IO interfaces (e.g., PCIe, DMI, UPI, DRAM) in shallow (nanosecond-scale transition latency) low-power modes. Third, a CLM Retention (CLMR) mode rapidly reduces the CLM (Cache-and-home-agent, Last-level-cache, and Mesh network-on-chip) domain's voltage to its retention level, drastically reducing its power consumption. Fourth, APC keeps all system PLLs active in PC 1A to allow nanosecond-scale exit latency by avoiding PLL re-locking overhead. Combining these techniques enables significant power savings while requiring less than 200ns transition latency, > 250× faster than existing deep package C-states (e.g., PC6), making PC 1A practical for datacenter servers. Our evaluation based on an Intel Skylake-based server shows that APC reduces the energy consumption of Memcached by up to 41% (25% on average) with <0.1% performance degradation. APC provides similar benefits for other representative workloads.  © 2022 IEEE.","energy; power; thermal management","Computer architecture; Dynamic frequency scaling; Facings; Locks (fasteners); Network-on-chip; Phase locked loops; Servers; Temperature control; Thermal management (electronics); Agile systems; CPU cores; CPU power; Datacenter; Distributed systems architectures; Energy; Energy proportionalities; Power; Power-saving; Scale transition; Network architecture","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141686653"

However, constantly changing workloads may contribute to resource over- or underutilization. The former violates the service level agreement's quality of service constraints. The latter indicates that as workload decreases, virtual machine resource utilization decreases. They introduce difficult decision-making tasks when dynamically adapting (e.g., migrating) a virtual machine in order to maximize its resource utilization over time. To address these challenges, we propose a newer mathematical model called the technical debt-aware computing model for virtual machine migration (TD4VM). The model promotes a holistic approach to dynamic virtual machine adaptation for cloud service providers and addresses existing issues regarding logical aspects of virtual machine adaptation in a highly dynamic cloud environment, which includes a measurement mechanism and estimation guidelines for estimating future debt and utility. Technical debt-aware models make decisions based on VM operating costs, quality, minimizing SLA violations, and incurring technical debt. This approach connects decisions about virtual machine migration that affect overall utility over time. Our method can determine whether a virtual machine should be moved when it is over or underutilized based on its technical debt. The experimental results on a dataset obtained from the Materna-trace-1 demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on a variety of performance metrics. A numerical comparison shows that TD4VM outperforms the other approaches, with VM resource economies of 171.84%, 91.33%, 97.85%, and 93.89% for TD4VM, LRMMT, IQRMC, and IQRMMT, respectively. Additionally, we quantify the debt amassed using TD4VM and state-of-the-art techniques. When compared to LRMMT, IQRMC, and IQRMMT, which cost (in $) 0.77, 0.73, and 0.76, respectively, TD4VM accumulates the minimum debt of 0.17. © 2022 Avneesh Vashistha et al.","","Energy utilization; Estimation; Green computing; Network security; Operating costs; Quality of service; Virtual addresses; Virtual machine; Changing workload; Computing model; CPU utilization; Iaas clouds; Low energy consumption; Memory utilization; Resources utilizations; Servicelevel agreement (SLA); Technical debts; Virtual machine migrations; Decision making","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129972617"

Contemplating the excessive rise of energy demands across the globe, this study introduces a predictive optimization-based nanogrid energy trading model that minimizes energy trading cost and provides an optimal energy sharing plan between peers connected within a nanogrid network/cluster. The proposed study comprises two folds: (1) PSO-enabled objective function incorporating actual and predicted values of essential energy attributes, is implemented to reduce the trading cost, (2) an intelligent time-aware energy sharing strategy to determine the role of peers, and foster the harness of renewable energy to meet the energy requirements. The study also comprehensively analyzes essential nano-grid energy parameters and predicts energy load, consumption, and cost to grasp the time-interval-based energy trends. In addition, an optimal ESS charging and discharging operation is devised to manage excess power efficiently. The proposed model is validated on the case study containing data of 12 nanogrid houses.

In order to sustain the rapid growth of computational demands, one of the most important QoS metrics for cloud schedulers is the execution cost. In this regard, several data-driven deep neural networks (DNNs) based schedulers have been proposed in recent years to allow scalable and efficient resource management in dynamic workload settings. However, optimal scheduling frequently relies on sophisticated DNNs with high computational needs implying higher execution costs. Further, even in non-stationary environments, sophisticated schedulers might not always be required and we could briefly rely on low-cost schedulers in the interest of cost-efficiency. Therefore, this work aims to solve the non-trivial meta problem of online dynamic selection of a scheduling policy using a surrogate model called MetaNet. Unlike traditional solutions with a fixed scheduling policy, MetaNet on-the-fly chooses a scheduler from a large set of DNN based methods to optimize task scheduling and execution costs in tandem. Compared to state-of-the-art DNN schedulers, this allows for improvement in execution costs, energy consumption, response time and service level agreement violations by up to 11, 43, 8 and 13 percent, respectively.  © 2022 IEEE.","Cloud Computing; Deep Learning; Scheduler Selection; Task Scheduling","Cloud computing; Energy utilization; Information management; Multitasking; Quality of service; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Cloud environments; Cloud-computing; Deep learning; Dynamic selection; Execution costs; Network-based; Quality-of-service; Scheduler selection; Scheduling policies; Tasks scheduling; Deep neural networks","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137586994"

The problem is challenging since NFV systems usually require multiple (often conflicting) design objectives and the computational efficiency of real-time decision making with limited information. Furthermore, the benefits of predictive scheduling to NFV systems still remain unexplored. In this article, we propose POSCARS, an efficient predictive and online service chaining and resource scheduling scheme that achieves tunable trade-offs among various system metrics with stability guarantee. Through a careful choice of granularity in system modeling, we acquire a better understanding of the trade-offs in our design space. By a non-trivial transformation, we decouple the complex optimization problem into a series of online sub-problems to achieve the optimality with only limited information. By employing randomized load balancing techniques, we propose three variants of POSCARS to reduce the overheads of decision making. Theoretical analysis and simulations show that POSCARS and its variants require only mild-value of future information to achieve near-optimal system cost with an ultra-low request response time. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","NFV; predictive scheduling; resource allocation; service chaining","Commerce; Computational efficiency; Economic and social effects; Electronic document exchange; Network function virtualization; Real time systems; Scheduling; Analysis and simulation; Complex optimization problems; Design objectives; Limited information; Predictive scheduling; Randomized load balancing; Real time decision-making; Resource-scheduling; Decision making","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104592413"

In recent two years, 5G pilot services have been launched to deal with the drastic increase in mobile devices and application types. However, since 5G adopts a higher frequency than conventional 3G/4G, base stations must be densified. Therefore, virtualization resources for softwarization in various technologies (e.g., Virtualized RAN (Radio Access Network), Virtualized Core, Virtualized Applications) are more appreciated. In this research, we focus on edge computing, which is one of the cores of Beyond 5G, to utilize the virtualization resources. Critical potentials of edge computing are traffic reduction, low latency, and high security for mobile networks. However, various studies were made based only on numerical analysis or parts of the trial of the experiment due to a lack of technical preparation for end-to-end (E2E) environments (e.g., devices, RAN, Core, applications, human resources) with software/hardware flexibility. To show the state-of-the-art edge computing for Beyond 5G (B5G), we established a true E2E B5G Edge Cloud in Ookayama Campus of Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan. In addition, focusing on the effective use of computation resources in Edge Clouds as an advantage of edge computing, we proposed a cloud-native with network function deployment architecture for computation resource sharing in different Edge Clouds. Specifically, we focused on Virtualized CU (Central Unit) in RAN and proposed to operate CU-CP (Control Plane) and CU-UP (User Plane) in different Edge Cloud. Its feasibility is validated through a measurement. © 2022 IEEE.","Beyond 5G; Edge Cloud; Micro-Service; Proof-of-Concept; Virtualization","Application programs; Life cycle; Mobile edge computing; Network function virtualization; Radio access networks; Transfer functions; Virtual reality; Beyond 5g; Central units; Computation resources; Distributed optimization; Edge clouds; Edge computing; Micro services; Proof of concept; Radio access networks; Virtualizations; 5G mobile communication systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137766990"

At the same time, it allows cloud providers to assert control in workload consolidation, i.e., co-locating multiple containers on the same server, thereby achieving higher server utilization, often at the cost of higher end-to-end function request latency. Interestingly, a key aspect of serverless latency management has not been well studied: the trade-off between application developers' latency goals and the FaaS providers' utilization goals. This paper presents a multi-faceted, measurement-driven study of latency variation in serverless platforms that elucidates this trade-off space. We obtained production measurements by executing FaaS benchmarks on IBM Cloud and a private cloud to study the impact of workload consolidation, queuing delay, and cold starts on the end-to-end function request latency. We draw several conclusions from the characterization results. For example, increasing a container's allocated memory limit from 128 MB to 256 MB reduces the tail latency by 2× but has 1.75× higher power consumption and 59% lower CPU utilization.  © 2021 ACM.","Function-as-a-Service; Multi-tenancy; Performance Modeling; Resource Management; Serverless Computing","Economic and social effects; Space platforms; Application developers; Critical service; End to end; Function-as-a-service; Multi tenancies; Performance Modeling; Resource management; Serverless computing; Trade off; Workload consolidation; Containers","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121448756"

Because of the increased deployment of energy meters, much data on electric energy is used. Developing cloud architecture technologies could utilize this data better to prevent power detection.

The cooperation of services leads to multiple intersecting microservice chains. And the intersection of microservices becomes a key position for resource competition. Therefore, rational allocation of microservices can improve resource utilization, reduce the task response time and solve the problem of resource competition caused by the intersection of microservice chains. However, existing research often ignores or simplifies the conflict problem caused by the intersection of microservice chains, resulting in poor system scheduling. Therefore, aiming at the above problem, this paper takes the resource utilization and the global response time as the measurement indicators to formally characterize the resource consumption of services and the task execution time in the microservice architecture. Combined with the advantages of parallel computing of the ant colony algorithm and local perturbations of simulated annealing algorithm, this paper proposes a chain-oriented task scheduling algorithm (COTSA). Experimental results show that compared with first come first service (FCFS) and ant colony optimization (ACO), the COTSA can effectively improve resource utilization and reduce the overall response time in the complex microservice environment. © 2021, The Editorial Board of Journal of Xidian University.

The notable industrial adoption has been sided by a growing interest from the software engineering community in general and the software architecture community in particular as demonstrated by the growing number of published peer-reviewed publications and proposed software architectural solutions for digital twins. In this paper, we report on the planning, execution, and results of a systematic mapping study on architecting digital twins. The study captures crucial aspects of software architectures for digital twins as types of architectural solutions, quality attributes, and architectural patterns. It supports practitioners in creating digital twins tailored to their specific needs and researchers in identifying trends and open challenges. Starting from an initial set of potentially relevant 1630 peer-reviewed publications, we selected 140 primary studies. We analysed the set of primary studies using thorough data extraction, analysis, and synthesis process. To compensate for single method limitations and reduce possible threats to conclusion validity, we discussed the results of our study with experts in the software architecture community.

For these CPS applications, service latency management is extraordinarily important for the sake of providing high quality-of-experience to terminal users. Edge-cloud computing, integrating both edge computing and cloud computing, is regarded as a promising computation paradigm to achieve low service latency for terminal users in CPS. However, existing latency-aware edge-cloud computing methods dedicated for CPS fail to jointly consider energy budgets and reliability requirements, which may greatly degrade the sustainability of CPS applications. In this article, we explore the problem of minimizing service latency of edge-cloud computing coupled CPS under the constraints of energy budgets and reliability requirements. We propose a two-stage approach composed of static and dynamic service latency optimization. At static stage, Monte-Carlo simulation with integer-linear-programming technique is adopted to find the optimal computation offloading mapping and task backup number. At dynamic stage, a backup-adaptive dynamic mechanism is developed to avoid redundant data transmissions and executions for achieving additional energy savings and service latency enhancement. Experimental results show that our solution is able to reduce system service latency by up to 18.3% compared with representative baseline solutions. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","cyber-physical systems; edge-cloud computing; energy; reliability; service latency minimization","Budget control; Cloud computing; Cyber Physical System; Dynamics; Embedded systems; Energy conservation; Monte Carlo methods; Quality of service; User experience; Automobile systems; Computation paradigms; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Healthcare monitoring; Integer Linear Programming; Optimal computation; Reliability requirements; Two stage approach; Integer programming","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099405976"

The approach starts from the emerging application of urban environmental monitoring based on vehicular networking, with an integrated design of data sensing detection and transmission, and collaborative monitoring of vehicle swarm intelligence based on urban air quality collection to avoid redundancy of information and communication overload. A hybrid routing method with minimal delay for reliable data transmission is proposed. The power adjustment algorithm divides the channel into 3 states. When the CBR is less than 0.5, the channel is in an idle state, and when the CBR is greater than 0.5 and less than 0.8, the channel is in an active state. The algorithm designs redundancy strategies based on coding mechanisms to improve the reliability of data transmission, combines coding mechanisms with routing design, incorporates routing switching ideas, and performs probability-based routing decisions to minimize the delay. In straight-line road sections, a fuzzy logic prediction-based vehicle adaptive connectivity clustering routing algorithm is proposed to reduce the communication overhead during vehicle collaboration and ensure high network connectivity; at intersections, a probability-based minimum delay routing decision algorithm is proposed to reduce the information transmission delay. Experiments show that the proposed method effectively improves the efficiency of data-aware collection and transmission, and increases the reliability of transmission. With the explosive growth of video services, the problem of intelligent transmission of DASH-based video streams has become another research hotspot in mobile edge networks. Based on the edge container cloud architecture of vehicular networking, the resource constraints of microservices when deployed in the edge cloud platform were analyzed, and a multi-objective optimization model for microservice resource scheduling was established with the comprehensive performance objectives of shortest microservice invocation distance, highest resource utilization of physical machine clusters, and ensuring load balancing as much as possible.  © 2022 Zheng Zhang et al.","","Air quality; Balancing; Clustering algorithms; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Multiobjective optimization; Quality of service; Redundancy; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Vehicle transmissions; Allocation algorithm; Coding mechanism; Collaborative resources; Distributed allocation; In-depth analysis; In-depth study; Resource allocation algorithms; Routing decisions; Telematics; Vehicular networkings; Telematics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138444386"

The Fog has been introduced to augment the apps with machines located at the network edge close to the end-users. However, edge machines are usually resource constrained. Thus, the execution of online data-analytics on edge machines may not be feasible if the time complexity of the data-analytics algorithm is high. To overcome this, multiple instances of the back-end should be deployed on edge and remote machines. In this case, the research question is how the switching of the app among the instances of the back-end can be dynamically decided based on the response time of the service instances. To answer this, we contribute an AI approach that trains machine-learning models of the response time of service instances. Our approach extends a back-end as a service into an AI self-back-end as a service that self-decides at runtime the right edge/remote instance that achieves the lowest response-time.

An improved genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the model with the completion time and delay time as the optimization objectives. First, heuristic rules are combined with GLR initialization methods to generate initial populations to improve population quality. Secondly, a simulated annealing algorithm with an elite retention strategy is introduced to screen the new population, and a neighborhood exchange strategy based on order priority ranking is proposed to overcome the problem that the iterative process is prone to illegal solutions. Finally, the encoding method and mutation repair mechanism are improved, and adaptive crossover and mutation operations are used to improve the search capability of the algorithm.

However, as an edge platform must perform the processing of multiple machine learning models concurrently for multimodal sensor data, its scheduling problem poses a new challenge to map heterogeneous machine learning computation to heterogeneous computing processors. Furthermore, processing of each input must provide a certain level of bounded response latency, making the scheduling decision critical for the edge platform. This article proposes a set of new heterogeneity-Aware ML inference scheduling policies for edge platforms. Based on the regularity of computation in common ML tasks, the scheduler uses the pre-profiled behavior of each ML model and routes requests to the most appropriate processors. It also aims to satisfy the service-level objective (SLO) requirement while reducing the energy consumption for each request. For such SLO supports, the challenge of ML computation on GPUs and DSP is its inflexible preemption capability. To avoid the delay caused by a long task, the proposed scheduler decomposes a large ML task to sub-Tasks by its layer in the DNN model. © 2021 ACM.","Edge computing; heterogeneous computing; inference; machine learning; task scheduling","Budget control; Energy utilization; Green computing; Machine learning; Program processors; Scheduling; Computational budget; Computing processors; Edge computing; Heterogeneous computing; Heterogeneous processors; Inference; Machine learning models; Remote servers; Sensors data; Service level objective; Edge computing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116413818"

In this architecture, service function chaining (SFC) creates an application-specific network overlay which determines the placement and ordering of network functions in a specific service delivery chain. The diverse choices for VNF placement over physical hardware, scheduling of VNF instances to run over the servers and design of optimal chaining mechanisms for traffic steering in the network have direct consequences on the quality-of-service (QoS) perceived by the network users. Previous surveys have focused on categorizing and evaluating various aspects of SFC, NFV and SDN. Due to the tight coupling of QoS provisioning with NFV problems, our work aims primarily at complementing the existing surveys in the sense that we review and classify the state-of-art research efforts in NFV design and implementation from the perspective of QoS provisioning.

This technology is the key factor that allows multiple applications to share resources, thereby enhancing the overall hardware utilization of cloud computing environments. However, multiple cloud-services contending for shared resources are susceptible to cross-application interference, which can lead to significant performance degradation and, consequently, an increase in Service Level Agreements violations. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art resource scheduling still relies mainly on resource capacity, adopting heuristics such as bin-packing and overlooking this source of overhead. But in recent years, interference-aware scheduling has gained traction, with the investigation of ways to classify applications regarding their interference levels and the proposal of static interference models and policies for scheduling co-hosted cloud applications. The preliminary results already show a considerable improvement in resource utilization and can be considered as the first steps toward a dynamic scheduling strategy. In this scenario, this paper proposes a machine learning-driven classification scheme for dynamic interference-aware resource scheduling in cloud computing environments. The main goal is to present how a classification approach, that better represents the workload variations, affects resource scheduling. In the first place, we analyze how hardware resources react to different applications with dynamic workloads. Then, we explore distinct interference classification formats and evaluate their efficiency, taking the dynamic nature of cloud workloads into account. Lastly, we present an interference-aware application classifier based on machine learning techniques and compare it with related work, adopting a variety of workload patterns. Preliminary results revealed an improvement in resource utilization efficiency by 27%, on average, when applying our classification approach in cloud infrastructures. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cloud computing; Cross-application interference; Dynamic resource scheduling; Interference-aware classification; Machine learning; Resource contention; Workload analysis","Efficiency; Machine learning; Platform as a Service (PaaS); Turing machines; Classification approach; Classification scheme; Cloud computing environments; Cloud infrastructures; Multiple applications; Performance degradation; Resource utilizations; Service Level Agreements; Scheduling","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101848639"

Existing display energy reduction (DER) algorithms focus on local video/image processing by utilizing the computation resources on the mobile devices. As such, a per-device DER strategy is highly inefficient from the systematic perspective since the same computation is repeated among millions of individual mobile devices. In this new era of cloud-based video streaming, a natural question to ask is can ubiquitous cloud resources be exploited to overcome these drawbacks. It is based on this motivation that we design a paradigm-shifting strategy to integrate the display energy saving engine into cloud-based video streaming in order to simultaneously benefit massive mobile devices with a one-time video processing in the cloud. By taking full advantage of the computational and storage resources in the cloud, a family of Rate-Distortion-Display Energy (R-D-DE) profiles can be created for a given video source and for different types of mobile devices.

Hence, buildings implement building management systems (BMSs), which monitor, control, manage and analyze each of these components. However, current BMSs are incapable of managing a massive amount of data (big data) and therefore cannot extract knowledge or make intelligent decisions in quasi real time. In addition, there are serious limitations to integrating BMSs with other services since they generally use proprietary software. In this sense, service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an architectural style that allows one to build distributed systems and provide functionalities such as services to end users or other types of services. Therefore, an SOA has the great advantage of allowing the expansion of the functionalities of BMSs. In fact, there are several studies that address SOAs for building management. However, we have not found any description or systematic analysis in the literature that allows the development of a versatile and interoperable SOA focused on the energy efficiency of buildings and that can integrate massive data analysis features. For these reasons, this study seeks to fill this knowledge gap and, more specifically, to identify and analyze the various software requirements proposed in the literature and the characteristics of big data that allow for improving the energy efficiency of buildings. To this end, we performed an in-depth review of the literature according to the methodology proposed by Kitchenham. As a result of this review, we provide researchers with a specific vision of the requirements and characteristics to consider for software development aimed at the energy efficiency of unique or historic buildings. © 2013 IEEE.","Big data applications; buildings; energy efficiency; energy management; management information systems; service-oriented systems engineering; software architecture","Big data; Distributed database systems; Information services; Intelligent buildings; Interoperability; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Software design; Building management; Building management system; Distributed systems; Intelligent decisions; Large amounts of data; Proprietary software; Software requirements; Systematic analysis; Energy efficiency","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101075127"

Edge computing, as an effective computing paradigm, was proposed for efficient and real-time data processing by providing computing resources at the edge of the network. The deployment of 5G promises to speed up data transmission but also further increases the tasks to be offloaded. However, how to transfer the data or tasks to the edge servers in 5G for processing with high response efficiency remains a challenge. In this paper, a latency-aware computation offloading method in 5G networks is proposed. Firstly, the latency and energy consumption models of edge computation offloading in 5G are defined. Then the fine-grained computation offloading method is employed to reduce the overall completion time of the tasks. The approach is further extended to solve the multiuser computation offloading problem. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive simulation experiments are conducted. The results show that the proposed offloading method can effectively reduce the execution latency of the tasks. © 2021 Xianwei Li and Baoliu Ye.","","Data handling; Digital storage; Edge computing; Energy utilization; Queueing networks; Computation offloading; Computation-intensive task; Computing capacity; Computing paradigm; Edge computing; Efficient time; Latency-aware; Quality-of-service; Real-time data processing; Storage capacity; 5G mobile communication systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116717984"

Computer systems employ a range of techniques to reduce overheads tied to data movement, spanning from traditional mechanisms (e.g., deep multi-level cache hierarch ies, aggressive hardware prefetcher s) to emerging techniques such as Near-Data Processing (NDP), where some computation is moved close to memory. Prior NDP works investigate the root causes of data movement bottlenecks using different profiling methodologies and tools. However, there is still a lack of understanding about the key metrics that can identify different data movement bottlenecks and their relation to traditional and emerging data movement mitigation mechanisms. Our goal is to methodically identify potential sources of data movement over a broad set of applications and to comprehensively compare traditional compute-centric data movement mitigation techniques (e.g., cach ing and prefetch ing) to more memory-centric techniques (e.g., NDP), thereby developing a rigorous understanding of the best techniques to mitigate each source of data movement. With this goal in mind, we perform the first large-scale characterization of a wide variety of applications, across a wide range of application domains, to identify fundamental program properties that lead to data movement to/from main memory. We develop the first systematic methodology to classify applications based on the sources contributing to data movement bottlenecks. From our large-scale characterization of 77K functions across 345 applications, we select 144 functions to form the first open-source benchmark suite (DAMOV) for main memory data movement studies. We select a diverse range of functions that (1) represent different types of data movement bottlenecks, and (2) come from a wide range of application domains.

However, localization accuracy is susceptible to inaccurate and high variant sensor measurements due to the unpredictable fluctuations of received wireless signals and the sensitivity of hardware devices. To address this issue, in this paper, we establish a new Bluetooth indoor localization system, whose architecture can be basically decomposed into two parts: the internet-of-things (IoT) framework and the localization module. Concretely, the IoT platform uses the state-of-the-art light weight Spring Boot microservice framework consisting of multi-layer structure. In the localization module, it follows the general process of trilateration but significantly distinguished from it. A set of measures are adopted to strengthen the system's robustness when obtained measurements cannot be fully trusted. Specifically, in the first place, rather than using conventional propagation model to predict the distance between Bluetooth transmitter and receiver, we design a bran-new LSTM-based distance estimator which can better depict the nonlinearity of attenuation characteristics of radio signal. Moreover, we also employ a series of self-adaptive mechanisms, including elastic radius intersecting, multiple weighted centroid localization and self-adaptive Kalman tracking, to make the system robust against inaccurate measurements and unpredictable sudden variation of received wireless signal. A bunch of tests are conducted in both ideal lab environment and Alibaba's large-scale warehouse, and experimental results show our indoor localization system outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmarks by a large margin in both localization accuracy and stability. © 2020 IEEE.","Bluetooth indoor localization; LSTM-based distance estimator; Self-adaptive Kalman tracking","Bluetooth; Environmental testing; Internet of things; Long short-term memory; Radio transmission; Signal receivers; Attenuation characteristics; Bluetooth transmitters; Indoor localization systems; Internet of thing (IOT); Localization accuracy; Multilayer structures; Self-adaptive mechanisms; Weighted centroid localizations; Indoor positioning systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093862399"

The cloud computing infrastructure hosts multiple cloud services that communicate with each other using the interfaces. During operation, the software systems accumulate errors or garbage that leads to system failure and other hazardous consequences. This status is called software aging. Software aging happens because of memory fragmentation, resource consumption in large scale and accumulation of numerical error. Software aging degrads the performance that may result in system failure. This happens because of premature resource exhaustion. The errors that cause software agings are of special types and target the response time and its environment. This issue is to be resolved only during run time as it occurs because of the dynamic nature of the problem. To alleviate the impact of software aging, software rejuvenation technique is being used. Rejuvenation process reboots the system or reinitiates the softwares. Software rejuvenation removes accumulated error conditions, frees up deadlocks and defragments operating system resources like memory. Software aging and rejuvenation has generated a lot of research interest recently. This work reviews some of the research works related to detection of software aging and identifies research gaps.

Although numerous mechanisms have been proposed to mitigate instruction cache misses, they still fall short of ideal cache behavior, and furthermore, introduce significant hardware overheads. We first investigate why existing I-cache miss mitigation mechanisms achieve sub-optimal performance for data center applications. We find that widely-studied instruction prefetchers fall short due to wasteful prefetch-induced cache line evictions that are not handled by existing replacement policies. Existing replacement policies are unable to mitigate wasteful evictions since they lack complete knowledge of a data center application's complex program behavior.To make existing replacement policies aware of these eviction-inducing program behaviors, we propose Ripple, a novel software-only technique that profiles programs and uses program context to inform the underlying replacement policy about efficient replacement decisions. Ripple carefully identifies program con-texts that lead to I-cache misses and sparingly injects ""cache line eviction""instructions in suitable program locations at link time. We evaluate Ripple using nine popular data center applications and demonstrate that Ripple enables any replacement policy to achieve speedup that is closer to that of an ideal I-cache. Specifically, Ripple achieves an average performance improvement of 1.6% (up to 2.13%) over prior work due to a mean 19% (up to 28.6%) I-cache miss reduction.  © 2021 IEEE.","Cache replacement; Frontend stalls","Cache memory; Energy efficiency; Green computing; Cache miss reduction; Hardware overheads; Instruction cache miss; Instruction caches; Program behavior; Replacement policy; Software-only techniques; Sub-optimal performance; Application programs","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113835906"

To this end, we integrate, using microservices, an MQTT based system that can collect ingress data, handle their persistency, and coordinate data integration with the cloud using a specific service called aggregator.

This leads to a significant waste of hardware resources, infrastructure investment, and energy consumption. As the diversity in application workloads grows into an essential characteristic in modern datacenters, task co-location of different workloads to the same compute cluster has gained immense popularity as a heuristic solution for resource utilization optimization. Although the existing co-location methodologies manage to improve resource efficiency to a certain degree, application QoS is usually sacrificed as a trade-off when dealing with resource interference between different applications. This paper proposes a containerized task co-location (CTCL) scheduler to improve resource utilization and minimize task eviction rate. Our CTCL scheduler (1) applies an elastic task co-location strategy to improve resource utilization; and (2) supports a dynamic task rescheduling mechanism to prevent severe QoS degradation from frequent task evictions. We evaluate our approach in terms of resource efficiency and rescheduling cost through the ContainerCloudSim simulator. Our experiments with the Alibaba 2018 workload traces demonstrate that CTCL could improve overall resource efficiency and reduce rescheduling rate by 38% and 99% respectively. © 2020 IEEE.","Cluster management; Container orchestration; Resource co-location; Resource heterogeneity; Workload characterization","Cloud computing; Containers; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Investments; Scheduling; Cloud computing environments; Essential characteristic; Hardware resources; Heuristic solutions; Industrial computing; Infrastructure investment; Resource efficiencies; Resource utilizations; Location","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088162872"

The workload prediction is being widely explored to solve these issues using time series analysis regression and neural networks based models. The time series analysis based models are unable to capture the dynamics in the workload behavior whereas neural network based models offer better accuracy on the cost of high training time. This paper presents a workload prediction model based on extreme learning machines (ELM) whose learning time is very low and forecasts the workload more accurately. The performance of the model is evaluated over two real world cloud server workloads i.e. CPU and Memory demand traces of Google cluster and compared with predictive models based on state-of-art techniques including Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Linear Regression (LR), Differential Evolution (DE), Blackhole Algorithm (BhA), and Propagation (BP).

Existing data center scheduling systems tightly pack containers to save power. However, with the growth of multi-tiered applications, there is a significant need to account for the affinity between application components, to minimize communication overheads and latency. Centralized container scheduling systems using graph partitioning algorithms cause a significant number of task migrations, with associated downtime. We design pMACH, a novel distributed container scheduling scheme for optimizing both power and task completion time in data centers. It minimizes task migrations and packs frequently communicating containers together without overloading servers. pMACH operates at peak energy efficiency, thus reducing energy consumption while also providing greater headroom for unpredictable workload spikes. We also propose in-network monitoring using smartNICs (sNIC) to measure the communications and then perform scheduling in a hierarchical, parallelized framework to achieve high performance and scalability. pMACH is based on incremental partitioning and it leverages the previous scheduling decision to significantly reduce the number of containers moved between servers, avoiding application downtime.

The next generation of low latency applications (e.g., Virtual Reality (VR), autonomous cars) adds even more stringent requirements to the infrastructure, calling for considerable advancements towards cloud-native micro-service-based architectures. This article presents a comprehensive survey on ongoing research aiming to effectively support low latency services throughout their execution lifetime in next-generation networks. The current state-of-the-art is critically reviewed to identify the most promising trends that will strongly impact the full applicability and high performance of low latency services. This article proposes a taxonomy as well as specific evaluation criteria to classify research across different domains addressing low latency service delivery. Current architectural paradigms such as Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) and Fog Computing (FC) alongside novel trends on communication networks are discussed. Among these, the integration of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial intelligence (AI) is introduced as a key research field in current literature towards autonomous network management.

IoT's underlying technology is to connect to central Cloud Computing (CC), which is a huge data center collecting the generated data by IoT devices, and it is located in different areas on demand. However, cloud computing lacks data transmission because of the infrastructure and limitations of networks which enormously decrease its performance. Therefore, a new paradigm has been founded to act as a middleware between the Cloud and IoT, termed Fog Computing (FC) Technology. Considering Fog as a cloud extension that provides computing service at the edge of the network, Fog Computing placement enables this technology to deal with numerous data locally.

Our objective is to evaluate and contrast the performance of the architectural patterns most commonly used for developing eHealth applications (i.e., service-oriented architecture (SOA) and microservices architecture (MSA)), using as reference the quantitative values obtained from the various performance tests and their ability to adapt to the required software attribute (i.e., versatile high-performance). Therefore, it was necessary to modify our platform to fit two architectural variants. As a follow-up to this activity, corresponding tests were performed that showed that the MSA variant functions better in terms of performance and response time compared to the SOA variant; however, it consumed significantly more bandwidth than SOA, and scalability in SOA is generally not possible or requires significant effort to be achieved. We conclude that the implementation of SOA and MSA depends on the nature and needs of organizations (e.g., performance or interoperability). © 2021 by the authors.

Moreover, in the last few years, we see the increasing adoption of container orchestration tools, such as Kubernetes, to simplify the management of multi-container applications. Kubernetes includes simple deployment policies that spread containers on computing resources located in the cluster and automatically scale them out or in based on some cluster-level metrics. As such, Kubernetes is not well-suited for deploying containers in a geo-distributed computing environment and dealing with the dynamism of application workload and computing resources. To tackle the problem, in this paper we present ge-kube (Geo-distributed and Elastic deployment of containers in Kubernetes), an orchestration tool that relies on Kubernetes and extends it with self-adaptation and network-aware placement capabilities. Ge-kube introduces flexible and decentralized control loops that can be easily equipped with different deployment policies. Specifically, we propose a two-step control loop, in which a model-based reinforcement learning approach dynamically controls the number of replicas of individual containers on the basis of the application response time, and a network-aware placement policy allocates containers on geo-distributed computing resources. To address the placement issue, we propose an optimization problem formulation and a network-aware heuristic, which explicitly take into account the non-negligible network delays among computing resources so to satisfy Quality of Service requirements of latency-sensitive applications. Using a surrogate CPU-intensive application and a real application (i.e., Redis), we conducted an extensive set of experiments, which show the benefits arising from the combination of elasticity and placement policies, as well as the advantages of using network-aware placement solutions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Containers; Elasticity; Geographically distributed resources; Kubernetes; Placement; Self-management","Application programs; Cluster computing; Decentralized control; Quality of service; Reinforcement learning; Computing resource; Decentralized control loops; Distributed computing environment; Distributed computing resources; Elastic deployment; Model-based reinforcement learning; Optimization problems; Sensitive application; Containers","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084943561"

To this end, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical security assessment model (SAM), able to assess the internal security level of software products based on low-level indicators, i.e., security-relevant static analysis alerts and software metrics. The model, following the guidelines of ISO/IEC 25010, and based on a set of thresholds and weights, systematically aggregates these low-level indicators in order to produce a high-level security score that reflects the internal security level of the analyzed software. The proposed model is practical, since it is fully automated and operationalized in the form of a standalone tool and as part of a broader Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) platform. In order to enhance its reliability, the thresholds of the model were calibrated based on a repository of 100 popular software applications retrieved from Maven Repository. Furthermore, its weights were elicited in a way to chiefly reflect the knowledge expressed by the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), through a novel weights elicitation approach grounded on popular decision-making techniques. The proposed model was evaluated on a large repository of 150 open-source software applications retrieved from GitHub and 1200 classes retrieved from the OWASP Benchmark. The results of the experiments revealed the capacity of the proposed model to reliably assess internal security at both product level and class level of granularity, with sufficient discretion power. They also provide preliminary evidence for the ability of the model to be used as the basis for vulnerability prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully automated, operationalized and sufficiently evaluated security assessment model in the modern literature. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Security Assessment; Software Quality Evaluation; Software Security","Application programs; Benchmarking; Computer aided software engineering; Decision making; Gages; Hierarchical systems; Open source software; Open systems; Risk assessment; Software design; Software reliability; Hierarchical model; Internal security; Quantitative security assessments; Secure software development; Security assessment; Software applications; Software products; Software security; Static analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106207514"

Changes are produced very quickly and software systems require evolving at the same velocity, which implies that the decision-making process of software architectures should be (semi-)automated to satisfy changing needs and to avoid wrong decisions. This issue is critical since suboptimal architecture design decisions may lead to high cost and poor software quality. Therefore, systematic and (semi-)automated mechanisms that help software architects during the decision-making process are required. Architectural patterns are one of the most important features of software applications, but the same pattern can be implemented in different ways, leaving to results of different quality. When an application requires to evolve, knowledge extracted from similar applications is useful for driving decisions, since quality pattern implementations can be reproduced in similar applications to improve specific quality attributes. Therefore, clustering methods are especially suitable for classifying similar pattern implementations. In this paper, we apply a novel unsupervised clustering technique, based on the well-known artificial neural network model Self-Organizing Maps, to classify Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern from a quality point of view. Software quality is analyzed by 24 metrics organized into the categories of Count/Size, Maintainability, Duplications, Complexity, and Design Quality. The main goal of this work is twofold: to identify the quality features that establish the similarity of MVC applications without software architect bias, and to classify MVC applications by means of Self-Organizing Maps based on quality metrics. To that end, this work performs an exploratory study by conducting two analyses with a dataset of 87 Java MVC applications characterized by the 24 metrics and two attributes that describe the technology dimension of the application. The stated findings provide a knowledge base that can help in the decision-making process for the architecture of Java MVC applications.  © 2013 IEEE.","artificial neural networks; machine learning; Model-view-controller; self-organizing maps (SOM); software architectures; software quality; unsupervised clustering techniques","Cluster analysis; Computer software selection and evaluation; Conformal mapping; Decision making; Java programming language; Knowledge based systems; Network architecture; Self organizing maps; Software architecture; Software quality; Architectural pattern; Architecture designs; Artificial neural network modeling; Decision making process; Exploratory studies; Model view controller; Software applications; Unsupervised clustering technique; Application programs","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103148325"

However, it is still a challenge to dynamically deploy them according to devices' heterogeneity and energy consumption concerns, while maintaining a defined QoS. Centralized and decentralized approaches that manage microservices deployment have the traditional pros and cons long discussed over time. While the former offer greater control over distributed application components, the latter offers frugal network negotiations, no system-wide crashes, privacy, among others. This work focuses on identifying ""ideal""host candidates for microservices' execution in a decentralized network, applying run-time scheduling operations (migration or duplication) to reduce energy consumption. To do this, we created a scheduling algorithm using MAAN (a P2P approach) to interpret a decentralized network as a multidimensional resource (capacity-demand) space, which supports range queries in a logarithmic quantity of hops. In this way, a node that runs a set of microservices is able to 1) map them in terms of their execution requirements (i.e. CPU frequency, RAM capacity, Network rate and disk speed) 2) Select an ideal microservice to be moved or duplicated, 3) find ideal node(s) that meet all those requirements in an optimal computational complexity and 4) negotiate the movement or duplication of the selected microservice, by analyzing energy consumption and QoS criteria. © 2021 ACM.","cloud computing; distributed algorithms; energy consumption; microservices; P2P; power consumption","Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Privacy by design; Decentralized approach; Decentralized networks; Distributed applications; Multi-dimensional entities; Network negotiations; Optimal computational complexity; Reduce energy consumption; Response efficiencies; Peer to peer networks","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104987718"

The most existing RM techniques and strategies have insufficiency in handling such cloud resources dynamic behaviour. To resolve these limitations, there is a need for the design and development of intelligent and efficient autonomic RM techniques to ensure the Quality-of-Service (QoS) of cloud-based applications, satisfy the cloud user requirements, and avoid a Service-Level Agreement (SLA) violations.

Container placement plays a vital role in network traffic and the performance of containerized data centers. Existing container placement techniques do not consider the container traffic pattern, which is inadequate. To resolve this conflict, we investigate network traffic between containers and observe that it exhibits a Zipf-like distribution. We propose a novel container placement approach - Blender - by leveraging the Zipf-like distribution. Based on network traffic correlation, Blender employs RefineAlg and SplitAlg to divide containers of applications into blocks, and place these blocks across virtual machines. Blender exhibits two salient features: (i) it minimizes inter-block traffic by arranging the containers that communicate frequently in the same block. (ii) it achieves good load balancing by combining blocks according to the resource types they require and distributing them across multiple PMs. We compare Blender against two state-of-the-art methods SBP and CA-WFD. The experimental results show that Blender significantly reduces communication traffic. In particular, for the same number of PMs, Blender reduces the traffic of SBP and CA-WFD by 22% and 32%, respectively. Furthermore, with Blender in place, the physical resources of hosting PMs are well balanced and utilized.  © 2021 EDAA.","cloud computing; container placement; data centers; load balancing; traffic-aware","Balancing; Blending; Container traffic; Network traffic; Parallel performance; Physical resources; Salient features; Traffic aware; Well balanced; Zipf-like distribution; Containers","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111055857"

Many companies are migrating their applications to such architectures to reap the benefits of microservices, such as increased flexibility, scalability and a smaller granularity of the offered functionality by a service. On the one hand, the benefits of microservices for functional testing are often praised, as the focus on one functionality and their smaller granularity allow for more targeted and more convenient testing. On the other hand, using microservices has their consequences (both positive and negative) on other types of testing, such as performance testing. Performance testing is traditionally done by establishing the baseline performance of a software version, which is then used to compare the performance testing results of later software versions. However, as we show in this paper, establishing such a baseline performance is challenging in microservice applications. In this paper, we discuss the benefits and challenges of microservices from a performance tester's point of view. Through a series of experiments on the TeaStore application, we demonstrate how microservices affect the performance testing process, and we demonstrate that it is not straightforward to achieve reliable performance testing results for a microservice application. © 2020 ACM.","DevOps; Microservices; Performance; Regression testing","Software design; Base-line performance; Functional testing; Increased flexibility; Performance testing; Reliable performance; Software versions; Software testing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085919253"

In heterogeneous Internet of things, according to the different working modes and functions, the nodes are divided into Internet of things devices, routing nodes, and base station. We use time slot multiplexing to improve the time slot utilization of continuous transmission in Internet of things. First, the time slot allocation table in a round is obtained by the time slot scheduling based on the routing tree. Then, the collision matrix and the transmission matrix are established based on the time slot allocation table in a round. Finally, the minimum time slot scheduling in continuous rounds is determined based on the routing tree and the detection matrix. The experimental results show that the resource scheduling based on routing tree and detection matrix effectively improves the utilization of time slots and improves the throughput of the Internet of things. © The Author(s) 2021.","Internet of things; matrix; resources scheduling; routing; time slot","Air traffic control; Forestry; Scheduling; Limited communication; Minimum time; Resource-scheduling; Routing trees; Time slot allocation; Time slot scheduling; Transmission matrix; Working mode; Internet of things","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103535623"

Cloud computing provides physical servers from its data center in order to process user requests. The cloud data center consumes a huge amount of energy due to lack of management of the data center servers as the container-based service consolidation is a nontrivial task. Since the containers require less resource footprint, consolidating it in servers might make resource availability sparse. In order to reduce the energy consumption of the cloud data center, we have proposed a green container-based consolidation of the services so that the maximum number of servers can be put into idle mode without affecting the application quality of experience. The service consolidation problem has been formulated as an optimization problem considering minimization of total energy consumption of the data center as the objective, and an algorithm named Energy Aware Service consolidation using baYesian optimization (EASY) has been proposed to solve the optimization. We have evaluated the EASY algorithm in simulation using python. The experimental results have shown that EASY improves the total energy consumption of the data centers. This improvement comes at the cost of a small increase of service response time as there exists a trade-off between energy consumption and service response time. © 2020 IEEE.","Bayesian optimization; Cloud Computing; Container; Energy Consumption; Service Consolidation","Computer software; Containers; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Power management; Quality of service; Application quality; Bayesian optimization; Cloud data centers; Distributed applications; Optimization problems; Resource availability; Service response time; Total energy consumption; Green computing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089422917"

The CloudIoT not only presents ubiquitous services through IoT nodes but it also provides virtually unlimited resources through services composition. The services composition problem aims to find a set of services among functionally equivalent services with different Quality of Service (QoS) concerning users' constraints. To this aim, previous studies calculate QoS values through service logs without considering the presence of anomalies in the existing QoS values; however, the dynamicity of distributed service environments and communication networks in CloudIoT environments causes anomalies in the QoS values. Therefore, existing approaches fail to model QoS values accurately that leads to service-level agreement (SLA) violation and penalties for service broker. To address this challenge, we propose a scalable anomaly-aware approach (SAIoT) including two main components: the first component models QoS values based on a machine learning anomaly detection technique, to remove the existing abnormal QoS records, and the second component finds a near-optimal composition by using an effective and efficient metaheuristic algorithm. The experimental results based on real-world data sets show that our approach achieves 30.64% of the average improvement in the QoS value of a composite plan with equal or even less price compared to the previous works, such as information theory-based and advertised QoS-based methods. © 2014 IEEE.","Anomaly detection; cloud computing; Internet of Things (IoT); optimization; scalability; services composition","Anomaly detection; Information theory; Internet of things; Machine learning; Turing machines; Application services; Component model; Distributed service; Meta heuristic algorithm; Service Level Agreements; Services composition; Ubiquitous Service; Users' -constraints; Quality of service","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101708119"

Broadly, carbon emissions have two sources: operational energy consumption, and hardware manufacturing and infrastructure. Although carbon emissions from the former are decreasing thanks to algorithmic, software, and hardware innovations that boost performance and power efficiency, the overall carbon footprint of computer systems continues to grow. This work quantifies the carbon output of computer systems to show that most emissions related to modern mobile and data-center equipment come from hardware manufacturing and infrastructure.

The first approach is to develop trajectory planning and motion control algorithms. The second approach is to reduce the number of auxiliary robots as much as possible. The rigidly programmed systems are less flexible and adaptive than systems capable of independent data analysis and pattern identification. Therefore, this study uses the neural network for robot training and an analytical module (AN) to make decisions regarding the quantity of robots. The AN assisted and non-assisted management systems were examined under the two scenarios, namely the steady and random increment of applications. In both scenarios, using the AN reduced the number of auxiliary robots and, consequently, robot collisions in the operating area. This can help to reduce the warehouse maintenance costs and improve manufacturing scalability.

A vast majority of these microservices typically span less than a second, have strict SLO requirements, and are chained together as per the requirements of an application. The aforementioned characteristics introduce a new set of challenges, especially in terms of container provisioning and management, as the state-of-the-art resource management frameworks, employed in serverless platforms, tend to look at microservice-based applications similar to conventional monolithic applications. Hence, these frameworks suffer from microservice agnostic scheduling and colossal container over-provisioning, especially during workload fluctuations, thereby resulting in poor resource utilization. In this work, we quantify the above shortcomings using a variety of workloads on a multi-node cluster managed by the Kubernetes and Brigade serverless framework. To address them, we propose Fifer Ð an adaptive resource management framework to efficiently manage function-chains on serverless platforms. The key idea is to make Fifer (i) utilization conscious by efficiently bin packing jobs to fewer containers using function-aware container scaling and intelligent request batching, and (ii) at the same time, SLO-compliant by proactively spawning containers to avoid cold-starts, thus minimizing the overall response latency. Combining these benefits, Fifer improves container utilization and cluster-wide energy consumption by 4× and 31%, respectively, without compromising on SLO's, when compared to the state-of-the-art schedulers employed by serverless platforms. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.","Queuing; Resource-management; Scheduling; Serverless","Energy utilization; Middleware; Natural resources management; Resource allocation; Scheduling; Adaptive Resource Management; Bin packing; Data centers; Multi-nodes; Over provisioning; Resource management framework; Resource utilizations; State of the art; Bins","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098501448"

For instance, designing automatic data transfer from the fog layer to cloud layer, which contains enormous distributed devices is challenging. Considering fog as the supporting processing layer, dealing with decentralized devices in the IoT and fog layer leads us to think of other automatic mechanisms to manage the existing heterogeneity. The big data and heterogeneity challenges also motivated us to design other automatic components for Fog resiliency, which we address as the third challenge in the ecosystem. Fog resiliency makes the processing of IoT tasks independent to the Cloud layer.

The space-based on-orbit service has the advantages of performing communication and calculations at the data source side, which can reduce the delay of satellite service data return, thereby responding quickly to emergencies. However, the high dynamic topology of satellite network and the sudden change of node access traffic will affect the on-orbit quality of service significantly. In order to approach this challenge, this paper proposes a space-based service architecture. Based on the real-time traffic data of the satellite network, the service is migrated according to the change of upstream and downstream traffic. In this paper, a migration model is constructed based on the network and mission characteristics of the space-based edge cloud. This migration model can balance the time delay dynamically and optimize the energy consumption by matching the migration node with the time delay and energy consumption. The simulation results show that the proposed service migration strategy can satisfy the customized requirements of different services, while reducing the service delay and packet loss rate under the network traffic congestion, so that the overall benefit of satellite network is improved. © 2020 IEEE.","Edge computing; Service migration; Space-based information network","Energy utilization; Image processing; Quality of service; Satellites; Time delay; Traffic congestion; Different services; On-orbit services; Real-time traffic datum; Satellite network; Satellite services; Service architecture; Service migration; Specific target detection; Orbits","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088899167"

Co-locating best-effort applications that have no QoS requirement with latency-sensitive services has been widely used to improve the resource utilization with careful shared resource management. However, existing co-location techniques tend to result in the power overload problem on power constrained computers due to the ignorance of the power consumption. To this end, we propose Sturgeon, a runtime system proactively manages resources between colocated applications in a power constrained environment, to ensure the QoS of latency-sensitive services while maximizing the resource utilization. Our investigation shows that, at a given load, there are multiple feasible resource configurations to meet both QoS requirement and power budget, while one of them yields the maximum throughput of best-effort applications. To find such a configuration, we establish models to accurately predict the performance and power consumption of the colocated applications. Sturgeon monitors the QoS periodically in order to eliminate the potential QoS violation caused by the unpredictable interference. The experimental results show that Sturgeon improves the throughput of best-effort applications by 24.96% compared to the state-of-the-art technique, while guaranteeing the 95%-ile latency within the QoS target. © 2020 IEEE.","Improved Utilization; Power Constrained Computers; QoS","Budget control; Electric power utilization; Green computing; Location; Best-effort applications; Maximum through-put; Overload problems; QoS requirements; Resource configurations; Resource utilizations; Shared resources; State-of-the-art techniques; Quality of service","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088902344"

Big data YARN clusters need to co-schedule diverse workloads on shared resources including batch processing jobs, streaming jobs, and other long-running applications such as web services, database services, etc. Current resource managers are only responsible for resource allocation among applications/jobs but completely unaware of runtime QoS requirements of interactive and latency-sensitive applications. Prior works to maximize the QoS of monolithic applications ignore inherent dependencies and temporal-spatio performance variability of components, characteristics of distributed applications primarily driven by microservices. In this paper, we present Toposch, a new resource management system to adaptively co-locate batch tasks and microservices by harvesting runtime latency. In particular, Toposch tracks full footprints of every request across microservices over time. A latency graph is periodically generated for identifying victim microservices through an end-to-end latency critical path analysis. We then exploit per-microservice and per-node risk assessment to gauge the visible resources to the capacity scheduler in YARN. Execution of batch tasks are adaptively throttled or delayed, thereby avoiding latency increase due to node over-saturation. TOPOSCH is integrated with YARN and experiments show that the latency of DLRAs can be reduced by up to 39.8% against the default capacity scheduling in YARN. © 2020 IEEE.","cluster management; latency sensitivity; microservice; workload co-location","Batch data processing; Cloud computing; Multitasking; Natural resources management; Quality of service; Regression analysis; Resource allocation; Risk assessment; Scheduling; Web services; Wool; Yarn; Distributed applications; End to end latencies; Long-running applications; Performance variability; Resource management; Resource management systems; Resource utilizations; Sensitive application; Critical path analysis","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099339956"

Design bugs that affect processor performance rather than its functionality are especially difficult to catch, particularly in new microarchitectures. This is because, unlike functional bugs, the correct processor performance of new microarchitectures on complex, long-running benchmarks is typically not deterministically known. Thus, when performance benchmarking new microarchitectures, performance teams may assume that the design is correct when the performance of the new microarchitecture exceeds that of the previous generation, despite significant performance regressions existing in the design. In this work we present a two-stage, machine learning-based methodology that is able to detect the existence of performance bugs in microprocessors. Our results show that our best technique detects 91.5% of microprocessor core performance bugs whose average IPC impact across the studied applications is greater than 1% versus a bug-free design with zero false positives. When evaluated on memory system bugs, our technique achieves 100% detection with zero false positives. Moreover, the detection is automatic, requiring very little performance engineer time.  © 2021 IEEE.","automatic; bugs; core; debugging; Machine Learning; microprocessor; Modeling; Performance","Computer architecture; Integrated circuit design; Program debugging; Supercomputers; Design process; False positive; Micro architectures; Microprocessor core; Performance benchmarking; Performance bugs; Processor design; Processor performance; Benchmarking","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104950921"

Efficient radio resource management is of paramount importance for network operators. With the advent of newer technologies, infrastructure, and plans, spending significant radio resources on estimating channel conditions in mobile networks poses a challenge. Automating the process of predicting channel conditions can efficiently utilize resources. To this point, we propose an ML-based technique, i.e., an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for predicting SINR (Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise-Ratio) in order to mitigate the radio resource usage in mobile networks. Radio resource scheduling is generally achieved on the basis of estimated channel conditions, i.e., SINR with the help of Sounding Reference Signals (SRS). The proposed Non-Linear Auto Regressive External/Exogenous (NARX)-based ANN aims to minimize the rate of sending SRS and achieves an accuracy of R = 0.87. This can lead to vacating up to 4% of the spectrum, improving bandwidth efficiency and decreasing uplink power consumption. © 2020 by the authors.

IoT can be divided into five main areas including: Health-care, Environmental, Smart city, Commercial and Industrial. The IoHT-MBA Platform is considered the backbone of every IoT architecture, so the optimal design of the IoHT-MBA Platform is essential issue, which should be carefully considered in the different aspects. Although, IoT is applied in multiple domains, however, there are still three main features that are challenge to improve: i) data collection, ii) users, devices management, and iii) remote device control. Today’s medical IoT systems, often too focused on the big data or access control aspects of participants, but not focused on collecting data accurately, quickly, and efficiently; power redundancy and system expansion. This is very important for the medical sector - which always prioritizes the availability of data for therapeutic purposes over other aspects. In this paper, we introduce the IoHT Platform for Healthcare environment which is designed by microservice and brokerless architecture, focusing strongly on the three aforementioned characteristics. In addition, our IoHT Platform considers the five other issues including (1) the limited processing capacity of the devices, (2) energy saving for the device, (3) speed and accurate of the data collection, (4) security mechanisms and (5) scalability of the system. Also, in order for the IoHT Platform to be suitable for the field of health monitoring, we also add realtime alerts for the medical team. In the evaluation section, moreover, we describe the evaluation to prove the effectiveness of the proposed IoHT Platform (i.e. the proof-of-concept) in the performance, non-error, and non affected by geographical distance. Finally, a complete code solution is publicized on the authors’ GitHub repository to engage further reproducibility and improvement. © 2021.

However, the on-demand use of energy is considered a big challenge to achieve the optimal cost for households. This paper proposes a blockchain-based predictive energy trading platform to provide real-time support, day-ahead controlling, and generation scheduling of distributed energy resources. The proposed blockchain-based platform consists of two modules; blockchain-based energy trading and smart contract enabled predictive analytics modules. The blockchain module allows peers with real-time energy consumption monitoring, easy energy trading control, reward model, and unchangeable energy trading transaction logs. The smart contract enabled predictive analytics module aims to build a prediction model based on historical energy consumption data to predict short-term energy consumption. This paper uses real energy consumption data acquired from the Jeju province energy department, the Republic of Korea. This study aims to achieve optimal power flow and energy crowdsourcing, supporting energy trading among the consumer and prosumer. Energy trading is based on day-ahead, real-time control, and scheduling of distributed energy resources to meet the smart grid's load demand. Moreover, we use data mining techniques to perform time-series analysis to extract and analyze underlying patterns from the historical energy consumption data. The time-series analysis supports energy management to devise better future decisions to plan and manage energy resources effectively. To evaluate the proposed predictive model's performance, we have used several statistical measures, such as mean square error and root mean square error on various machine learning models, namely recurrent neural networks and alike. Moreover, we also evaluate the blockchain platform's effectiveness through hyperledger calliper in terms of latency, throughput, and resource utilization. Based on the experimental results, the proposed model is effectively used for energy crowdsourcing between the prosumer and consumer to attain service quality.  © 2013 IEEE.","blockchain; energy prediction; Energy trading; machine learning; predictive analysis","Blockchain; Crowdsourcing; Data mining; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Fintech; Harmonic analysis; Learning systems; Mean square error; Microgrids; Peer to peer networks; Power markets; Predictive analytics; Real time control; Recurrent neural networks; Scheduling; Time series analysis; Distributed Energy Resources; Electrical power supply; Energy consumption datum; Generation scheduling; Machine learning models; Resource utilizations; Root mean square errors; Statistical measures; Smart power grids","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101538996"

This practice gives substantial benefits to both the clients and the software-provider in terms of costs, flexibility, ubiquity and performance. In this document, an outsourcing architecture is proposed based on this paradigm. Extensive experiments have been done using highly parallelizable computational geometry operations to show the strengths and weaknesses of the proposal in combination of specialized computing platforms in the cloud. The results suggest that there are some issues that affect the overall performance and the stability of the QoS: the network communication delay, and the number of simultaneous clients and multiple requests.

Among the others, steganography and information hiding can be used to bypass security frameworks searching for suspicious communications between processes or exfiltration attempts through covert channels. Since the array of potential carriers is very large (e.g., information can be hidden in hardware resources, various multimedia files or network flows), detecting this class of threats is a scarcely generalizable process and gathering multiple behavioral information is time-consuming, lacks scalability, and could lead to performance degradation. In this paper, we leverage the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF), which is a recent code augmentation feature provided by the Linux kernel, for programmatically tracing and monitoring the behavior of software processes in a very efficient way. To prove the flexibility of the approach, we investigate two realistic use cases implementing different attack mechanisms, i.e., two processes colluding via the alteration of the file system and hidden network communication attempts nested within IPv6 traffic flows. Our results show that even simple eBPF programs can provide useful data for the detection of anomalies, with a minimal overhead. Furthermore, the flexibility to develop and run such programs allows to extract relevant features that could be used for the creation of datasets for feeding security frameworks exploiting AI. © 2021","Covert channels; Detection; eBPF; Stegomalware; Syscall and network tracing","Error detection; Malware; Multimedia systems; Berkeley packet filters; Covert channels; Detection; Extended berkeley packet filter; Linux environment; Malwares; Security frameworks; Signature based detections; Stegomalware; Syscall and network tracing; Linux","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103087571"

However, they usually treat an LC workload as a whole when allocating resources to BE jobs and neglect the different features of components of an LC workload. This kind of coarse-grained co-location method leaves a significant room for improvement in resource utilization. Based on the observation of the inconsistent interference tolerance abilities of different LC components, we propose a new abstraction called Servpod, which is a collection of a LC parts that are deployed on the same physical machine together, and show its merits on building a fine-grained co-location framework. The key idea is to differentiate the BE throughput launched with each LC Servpod, i.e., Servpod with high interference tolerance ability can be deployed along with more BE jobs. Based on Servpods, we present Rhythm, a co-location controller that maximizes the resource utilization while guaranteeing LC service's tail latency requirement. It quantifies the interference tolerance ability of each servpod through the analysis of tail-latency contribution. We evaluate Rhythm using LC services in forms of containerized processes and microservices, and find that it can improve the system throughput by 31.7%, CPU utilization by 26.2%, and memory bandwidth utilization by 34% while guaranteeing the SLA (service level agreement). © 2020 ACM.","","Location; Machine components; Cloud service providers; Coarse-grained; CPU utilization; Interference tolerance; Memory bandwidths; Resource utilizations; Service Level Agreements; System throughput; Location based services","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087109878"

The set of files is similar to the object of interest image files. It means, that we can't identical any objects. Then we rewrite files to the target directory. This set should later be used for training a neural network. Images of the object of interest can be in any orientation and on any background. This non-identity must be recognized by a trained neural network. For the purposes of forming such a set, we will need an identifier that has sufficient accuracy for these purposes. Here we do not need very high accuracy. The very identification error of this preliminary analyzer helps us of introducing some dissimilarity between the objects of the images. The task is complicated by the fact that objects can have different sizes (scale) and orientation in space.

The growth in human life expectancy is increasing due to medical technologies and nutritional science innovations. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the connectivity of physical objects called things to the Internet. IoT has a wide range of health monitoring applications based on biomedical sensing devices to monitor health conditions. This paper proposes elderly patients’ health monitoring architecture based on an intelligent task mapping approach for a closed-loop IoT healthcare environment. As a case study, a health monitoring system was developed based on the proposed architecture for elderly patients’ health monitoring in the home, ambulance, and hospital environment. The system detects and notifies deteriorating conditions to the authorities based on biomedical sensors for faster interventions. Wearable biomedical sensors are used for monitoring body temperature, heart rate, blood glucose level, and patient body position. Threshold and machine learning-based approaches were used to detect anomalies in the health sensing data. The proposed architecture’s performance analysis is evaluated in terms of round trip time, reliability, task drop rate, and latency performance metrics. Performance results show that the proposed architecture of the elderly patient health monitoring can provide reliable solutions for critical tasks in IoT environments. © 2021 by the authors.

Schemes and appropriate models for dynamic resources provisioning in the cloud environment have been extensively studied. To date, the research literature is lacking schemes and models that offer dynamic scalability in which Quality of Service (QoS) and high performance are provided to customers with the usage of the least number of cloud resources, especially for containerized services hosted on the cloud. With dynamic scalability, cloud computing can offer on-demand, timely, and dynamically adjustable computing resources to services hosted on the cloud. This paper presents a dynamic scaling model based on queueing theory to scale containers virtual resources and satisfy the customer Service Level Agreements (SLA) while guarding costs of scaling very low. The aim is to improve the virtual computing resources utilization and satisfy SLA constraints in terms of CPU utilization, system response time, system drop rate, system number of tasks, and system throughput. Simulation results are provided using Java Modelling Tools simulation tool, which shows that our proposed model can determine under any offered workload the needed containers instances to satisfy the required QoS parameters. © 2020, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.","Cloud computing; Containerized cloud services; Containers; Performance modeling; Resource efficiency","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089528810"

As a new representative of virtualization technology, containers have been widely used in software development, operation and maintenance, testing and other aspects, such as microservices and Docker Cloud. In cloud data centers, containers have gradually replaced virtual machines (VMs) as a new carrier for cloud tasks. However, with the increasing number of cloud products, the scale of tasks requested by users in cloud data centers continues to expand. The economic cost of tasks in the process of containerized deployment has become a concern of various cloud service vendors. The container deployment cost usually includes the data exchange cost, the image pull cost and the server energy cost. In order to solve the containerized deployment of application tasks in the container cloud environment with the lowest possible container deployment cost, this paper proposes a new cost calculation model in a container cloud environment, and then presents an improved particles swarm algorithm, namely a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for container deployment (CD-PSO) to provide the best solution for application task loading. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a lower deployment cost than other scheduling algorithms. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Cloud computing; Containers; Electronic data interchange; Intelligent computing; Scheduling algorithms; Signal processing; Software design; Software testing; Virtualization; Application tasks; Cloud data centers; Cloud environments; Cost calculation; Deployment costs; Operation and maintenance; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Virtualization technologies; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086374003"

Mitigating instruction cache misses is challenging since existing techniques (1) require significant hardware modifications, (2) expect impractical on-chip storage, or (3) prefetch instructions based on inaccurate understanding of program miss behavior. To overcome these limitations, we first investigate the challenges of effective instruction prefetching. We then use insights derived from our investigation to develop I-SPY, a novel profiledriven prefetching technique. I-SPY uses dynamic miss profiles to drive an offline analysis of I-cache miss behavior, which it uses to inform prefetching decisions. Two key techniques underlie ISPY's design: (1) conditional prefetching, which only prefetches instructions if the program context is known to lead to misses, and (2) prefetch coalescing, which merges multiple prefetches of noncontiguous cache lines into a single prefetch instruction. I-SPY exposes these techniques via a family of light-weight hardware code prefetch instructions. We study I-SPY in the context of nine data center applications and show that it provides an average of 15.5% (up to 45.9%) speedup and 95.9% (and up to 98.4%) reduction in instruction cache misses, outperforming the state-of-the-art prefetching technique by 22.5%. We show that I-SPY achieves performance improvements that are on average 90.5% of the performance of an ideal cache with no misses. © 2020 IEEE Computer Society.

However, the Cloud infrastructure consumes a significant amount of electrical energy to provide services to its users that have a detrimental effect on the environment. Many of these applications (tasks), like those belonging to the healthcare system, scientific research, the Internet of Things (IoT), and others, are deadline-sensitive. Hence efficient scheduling of tasks is essential to prevent deadline violation, decrease makespan, and at the same time reduce energy consumption. To address this issue, we have considered the bi-objective optimization problem of minimization of energy and makespan and have proposed two scheduling approaches for independent, deadline-sensitive tasks in a heterogeneous Cloud environment. Our first approach is a greedy heuristic based on the Linear Weighted Sum technique. The second one is based on Ant Colony Optimization and uses a combination of heuristic search and positive feedback of information to improve the solution. Both approaches use a three-tier model where tasks are scheduled by taking into account the properties of three entities- tasks, VMs, and hosts. Moreover, we have proposed a suitable strategy for scaling of Cloud resources to improve energy-efficiency and task schedulability. Extensive simulations using Google Cloud trace-logs and comparison with some state-of-art approaches validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheduling techniques in achieving a proper trade-off between the energy consumption of the virtualized Cloud infrastructure and the average makespan of the tasks. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Ant colony optimization; Cloud computing; Deadline; Energy; Makespan; Task scheduling","Ant colony optimization; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Heuristic algorithms; Internet of things; Scheduling; Bi-objective optimization; Cloud infrastructures; Efficient scheduling; Extensive simulations; Internet of thing (IOT); Reduce energy consumption; Scheduling techniques; Scientific researches; Green computing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104852944"

Since then, the software development industry increasingly began using such methods, that are various. At the core of all Agile methods, however, lies an assumption: it is the interactions between people, not just processes and plans, that allows for successful product delivery and projects productivity. Hence, Agile methods typically focus on how groups of individuals with different but often complementary skill-sets can mutually interact or self-organise to build high-performing teams capable of developing, testing, and delivering software valuable for the users and stakeholders. The validation of such methodologies in the software development industry nevertheless requires a careful analysis of the potential challenges and impediments that agile teams may encounter during their collaboration; so, a practical investigation over the root causes of these potential issues. Our aim in this paper is twofold. Firstly, we want to gather all currently defined root causes of interaction issues and impediments in agile teams. Secondly, we intend to review and systematically analyse the most common of them in order to build appropriate mitigation strategies, which -we hope- will contribute to decreasing their potential occurrences in future works. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Agile methodologies; Interaction issues; Personal communication; Software development; Team management","Software testing; Agile methods; Agile software development; Agile teams; Mitigation strategy; Practical investigations; Product delivery; Root cause; Skill sets; Software design","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105950736"

Co-locating best-effort applications that have no QoS requirement with the latency-sensitive services has been widely used to improve the resource utilization of datacenters with careful shared resource management. However, existing co-location techniques tend to result in the power overload problem on power constrained servers due to the ignorance of the power consumption. To this end, we propose Sturgeon, a runtime system proactively manages resources between co-located applications in a power constrained environment, to ensure the QoS of latency-sensitive services while maximizing the throughput of best-effort applications. Our investigation shows that, at a given load, there are multiple feasible resource configurations to meet both QoS requirement and power budget, while one of them yields the maximum throughput of best-effort applications. To find such a configuration, we establish models to accurately predict the performance and power consumption of the co-located applications. Sturgeon monitors the QoS of the services periodically, in order to eliminate the potential QoS violation caused by the unpredictable interference. Besides, when the datacenter hosts different types of applications to perform co-location, Sturgeon places applications with their preferable candidates to improve the overall throughput. The experimental results show that at server level Sturgeon improves the throughput of the best-effort application by 25.43 percent compared to the state-of-the-art technique, while guaranteeing the 95%-ile latency within the QoS target; at cluster level, Sturgeon improves the overall throughput of best-effort applications by 13.74 percent compared to the baseline.  © 1990-2012 IEEE.","improved utilization; power constrained datacenters; QoS","Budget control; Electric power utilization; Green computing; Location; Adaptive preferences; Best-effort applications; Maximum through-put; Overload problems; Resource configurations; Resource utilizations; Shared resources; State-of-the-art techniques; Quality of service","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093985197"

Devices in the IoT network are often geared towards mobility and compact in size, thus having a rather weak hardware configuration. There are many light weight protocols, tailor-made suitable for limited processing power and low energy consumption, of which MQTT is the typical one. The current MQTT protocol supports three types of quality-of-service (QoS) and the user has to trade-off the security of the packet transmission by transmission rate, bandwidth and energy consumption. The MQTT protocol, however, does not support packet storage mechanisms which means that when the receiver is interrupted, the packet cannot be retrieved. In this paper, we present a broker-less SIP-MBA Platform, designed for micro-service and using gRPC protocol to transmit and receive messages. This design optimizes the transmission rate, power consumption and transmission bandwidth, while still meeting reliability when communicating. Besides, we implement users and things management mechanisms with the aim of improving security issues.

Based on the connected devices, various applications can be developed by integrating domain-specific contents using the service composition for providing improved services. The management of the information including devices, contents, and composite objects is necessary to represent the physical objects on the Internet for accessing the IoT services transparently. In this paper, we propose an integrated service composition approach based on multiple service providers to provide improved IoT services by combining various service objects in heterogeneous IoT networks. In the proposed IoT architecture, each service provider provides web services based on Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API) that delivers information to the clients as well as other providers for integrating the information to provide new services. Through the REST APIs, the integration management provider combines the service result of the IoT service provider to other contents to provide improved services. Moreover, the interworking proxy is proposed to bridge heterogeneous IoT networks for enabling transparent access in the integrated services through proving protocol translating on the entry of the device networks. Therefore, the interworking proxy is deployed between the IoT service provider and device networks to enable clients to access heterogeneous IoT devices through the composited services transparently. © 2021 Wenquan Jin et al.","","Application programming interfaces (API); Interface states; Internet protocols; Internet service providers; Quality of service; Web services; Heterogeneous technology; Integrated service; Internet of thing (IOT); Iot architectures; Representational state transfer; Service compositions; Standard specifications; Transparent access; Internet of things","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107796560"

Building on existing solutions utilising a communication threshold between static nodes and a sink node using a predictable mobility pattern, DMEAAL takes knowledge of optimum energy consumption levels and implements a cross-layer approach, utilising current energy consumption and dynamically adjusting communication threshold size based on target energy consumption. This approach is shown to balance energy consumption across individual nodes without increasing overall energy consumption compared to previous solutions. This without detrimentally affecting frame delivery to the sink. As such, network lifetime is improved.

In this paper, an extensive literature review is presented that identifies the challenges related to the adoption of container technologies in High Performance Computing, Big Data analytics, and geo-distributed (Edge, Fog, Internet-of-Things) applications. From our study, it emerges that performance, orchestration, and cyber-security are the main issues. For each challenge, the state-of-the-art solutions are then analyzed. Performance is related to the assessment of the performance footprint of containers and comparison with the footprint of virtual machines and bare metal deployments, the monitoring, the performance prediction, the I/O throughput improvement. Orchestration is related to the selection, the deployment, and the dynamic control of the configuration of multi-container packaged applications on distributed platforms. The focus of this work is on run-time adaptation. Cyber-security is about container isolation, confidentiality of containerized data, and network security. From the analysis of 97 papers, it came out that the state-of-the-art is more mature in the area of performance evaluation and run-time adaptation rather than in security solutions.

With rise of wearable computing in the era of IoT-driven smart applications, programmers now expect the time to market for these devices to be shortened. While support for IoT programming in general has gathered traction, tool proposals that automate the development of smart solutions based on the Internet of Wearable Things, though of paramount importance, still stay on the sidelines. We propose a code generation tool called Micraspis that allows a wearable to be described both functionally and architecturally - as if they are two sides of the same coin. The tool has an underlying model-to-code transformation mechanism to generates source code that is executable on a specific IoT programming platform such as Arduino. Our experiments demonstrate that programming code generated by Micraspis amounts to at least 60% of the source code needed to fulfill the business logic of ordinary wearable devices. We conduct an interview to meticulously collect programmers' assessment on how Micraspis assists them in programming and architecting smart IoT wearables. A total of 161 programmers responded to a Likert scale questionnaire, with which at least 65% of them either agree or strongly agree. Overall, the results show that Micraspis has promising applicability in supporting IoWT-enabled smart solutions. © 2013 IEEE.","code generation; Internet of Wearable Things; state machine; Wearable computing","Computation theory; Computer programming; Cosine transforms; Fire extinguishers; Wearable technology; Code generation tools; Code transformation; Medical treatment; Programming codes; Smart applications; Smart solutions; Wearable computing; Wearable devices; Internet of things","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110850204"

Thanks to the development of the IoT, researchers have devoted themselves to technologies that convert a conventional home into an intelligent occupants-aware place to manage electric resources with autonomous devices to deal with excess energy consumption and providing a comfortable living environment. There are studies to supplement the innate shortcomings of the IoT and improve intelligence by using cloud computing and machine learning. However, the machine learning-based autonomous control devices lack flexibility, and cloud computing is challenging with latency and security. In this paper, we propose a rule-based optimization mechanism on an embedded edge platform to provide dynamic home appliance control and advanced intelligence in a smart home. To provide actional control ability, we design and developed a rule-based objective function in the EdgeX edge computing platform to control the temperature states of the smart home. Compared to cloud computing, edge computing can provide faster response and higher quality of services. The edge computing paradigm provides better analysis, processing, and storage abilities to the data generated from the IoT sensors to enhance the capability of IoT devices concerning computing, storage, and network resources. In order to satisfy the paradigm of distributed edge computing, all the services are implemented as microservices. The microservices are connected to each other through REST APIs based on the constrained IoT devices to provide all the functionalities that accomplish a trade-off between energy consumption and occupant-desired environment setting for the smart home appliances. We simulated our proposed system to control the temperature of a smart home; through experimental findings, we investigated the application against the delay time and overall memory consumption by the embedded edge system of EdgeX. The result of this research work suggests that the implemented services operated efficiently in the raspberry pi 3 hardware of IoT devices. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

At the same time, proposes a novel concept of ubiquitous power Internet of things (UPIoTs) to improve the energy-using environment and quality. In the context of above proposal, to research how UPIoTs promotes the consumption of wind power especially has become a crucial task. The purpose of this paper is to identify influence factors through literature review and expert interview on the basis of relationship between the referenced two. During the process of exploring effects among factors, the improved interpretative structural modeling (ISM) coupled with fuzzy order relation analysis method (fuzzy G1 method) is constructed and adopted to make up for the shortcomings of traditional method. According to the results, three factors are considered as the most influential and some suggestions are given from these three aspects, aiming at making a contribution to the solutions in theory and in practice. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy consumption; Fuzzy G1-ISM; Non-grid-connected; Ubiquitous power Internet of things; Wind power","Electric power generation; Energy utilization; Internet of things; Wind power; Clean energy; Explosive growth; Fuzzy order relations; Interpretative structural modeling; Literature reviews; Non-grid-connected wind power; Novel concept; Wind power in chinas; Energy efficiency","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083817486"

To address these challenges, edge computing paradigms, namely Fog Computing (FC), Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and Cloudlet, have emerged to shift the digital services from centralized cloud computing to computing at edges. In this article, we analyze cloud and edge computing paradigms from features and pillars perspectives to identify the key motivators of the transitions from one type of virtualized computing paradigm to another one. We then focus on computing and network virtualization techniques as the essence of all these paradigms, and delineate why virtualization features, resource richness and application requirements are the primary factors for the selection of virtualization types in IoT frameworks. Based on these features, we compare the state-of-the-art research studies in the IoT domain. We finally investigate the deployment of virtualized computing and networking resources from performance perspective in an edge-cloud environment, followed by mapping of the existing work to the provided taxonomy for this research domain. The lessons from the reviewed are that the selection of virtualization technique, placement and migration of virtualized resources rely on the requirements of IoT services (i.e., latency, scalability, mobility, multi-tenancy, privacy, and security). As a result, there is a need for prioritizing the requirements, integrating different virtualization techniques, and exploiting a hierarchical edge-cloud architecture. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Classical virtualization; Fog Computing; Mobile Edge Computing; Network function Virtualization (NFV)","Edge computing; Fog computing; Internet of things; Privacy by design; Virtualization; Adaptive communications; Application requirements; Internet of Things (IOT); Network virtualization; Real-time application; Resource Virtualization; Virtualization Techniques; Virtualized resources; Mobile cloud computing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099789900"

MNOs have to ensure operational excellence by meeting several objectives. In this context, we propose in this paper, a framework for optimizing the mapping of next Generation Node-Bs (gNBs) to Software-Defined 5G Core (5GC) delay tolerant Network Functions (NFs). These NFs are considered to be deployed as a Virtual Machine (VM) pool, or containers, in order to minimize cloud computing cost, processing power and at the same time maximize network load. First, we formulate this problem as an integer linear program, while taking into account multiple constraints including Virtual Central Processing Unit (vCPU) capacity, central processing load limits and integrality of mapping relations between gNBs and 5GC NFs. Then, we propose an algorithm to solve large problem instances based on Branch, Cut and Price (BCP) combining all of 'Branch and Price', 'Branch and Cut' and 'Branch and Bound' frameworks. We present several schemes reflecting different optimization goals that the MNO can foster: virtualization cost, power minimization, network load or all. Simulation results demonstrate the good performance of our proposed algorithm to solve the gNBs-VM pool mapping for all evaluated schemes, while also emphasizing the advantages of a particular one (EWoS-333 for Equal Weight optimization Scheme) that can decrease virtualization cost by almost one order of magnitude compared to a static selection scheme, while considering the other two objectives.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","5G; branch; cut and price (BCP); mobile network operator (MNO); Multi-objective optimization; virtualized network functions","Balancing; Delay tolerant networks; Integer programming; Mapping; Program processors; Virtual machine; Virtualization; Wireless networks; Cloud computing costs; Integer linear programs; Mobile network operators; Multiple constraint; Operational excellence; Optimization goals; Power minimization; Weight optimization; 5G mobile communication systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085129294"

On the other hand, the need for highly scalable execution of stateless tasks for cloud systems is driving the definition of new technologies based on serverless computing. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture where the two converge to enable low-latency applications: This is achieved by offloading short-lived stateless tasks from the user terminals to edge nodes. Furthermore, we design a distributed algorithm that tackles the research challenge of selecting the best executor, based on real-time measurements and simple, yet effective, prediction algorithms. Finally, we describe a new performance evaluation framework specifically designed for an accurate assessment of algorithms and protocols in edge computing environments, where the nodes may have very heterogeneous networking and processing capabilities.

The computational resources are provided through large-scale datacenters, which consume substantial amount of energy and have, therefore, ecological impacts. Since long, Google runs users' applications in containers, Rackspace offers bare-metal hardware, whereas AWS runs them either in VMs (EC2), containers (ECS) and/or containers inside VMs (Lambda); therefore, making resource management a tedious activity. The role of a resource management system is of the greatest importance, principally, if IT companies practice various kinds of sand-boxing technologies, for instance, bare-metal, VMs, containers, and/or nested containers in their datacenters (hybrid platforms). The absence of centralised, workload-aware resource managers and consolidation policies produces questions on datacenters energy efficiency, workloads performance, and users' costs. In this paper, we demonstrate, through several experiments, using the Google workload data for 12,583 hosts and approximately one million tasks that belong to four different kinds of workload, the likelihood of: (i) using workload-aware resource managers in hybrid clouds; (ii) achieving energy and cost savings, in heterogeneous hybrid datacenters such that the workload performance is not affected, negatively; and (iii) how various allocation policies, combined with different migration approaches, will impact on datacenter's energy and performance efficiencies. Using plausible assumptions for hybrid datacenters set-up, our empirical evaluation suggests that, for no migration, a single scheduler is at most 16.86% more energy efficient than distributed schedulers. Moreover, when migrations are considered, our resource manager can save up to 45.61% energy and can improve up to 17.9% workload performance. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Containerisation; Datacenters; Energy efficiency; Performance; Resource management; Server consolidation; Virtualisation; Workload migration","Containers; Energy efficiency; Managers; Natural resources management; Resource allocation; Scheduling; Web services; Cloud computing environments; Computational resources; Distributed schedulers; Empirical evaluations; Energy and cost savings; Performance efficiency; Plausible assumptions; Resource management systems; Green computing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095771891"

Cities can be viewed as a microcosm of interconnected “objects” with which citizens interact daily, which represents an extremely interesting example of a cyber physical system (CPS), where the continuous monitoring of a city’s status occurs through sensors and processors applied within the real-world infrastructure. Each object in a city can be both the collector and distributor of information regarding mobility, energy consumption, air pollution as well as potentially offering cultural and tourist information. As a consequence, the cyber and real worlds are strongly linked and interdependent in a smart city. New services can be deployed when needed, and evaluation mechanisms can be set up to assess the health and success of a smart city. In particular, the objectives of creating ICT-enabled smart city environments target (but are not limited to) improved city services; optimized decision-making; the creation of smart urban infrastructures; the orchestration of cyber and physical resources; addressing challenging urban issues, such as environmental pollution, transportation management, energy usage and public health; the optimization of the use and benefits of next generation (5G and beyond) communication; the capitalization of social networks and their analysis; support for tactile internet applications; and the inspiration of urban citizens to improve their quality of life. However, the large scale deployment of cyber-physical-social systems faces a series of challenges and issues (e.g., energy efficiency requirements, architecture, protocol stack design, implementation, and security), which requires more smart sensing and computing methods as well as advanced networking and communications technologies to provide more pervasive cyber-physical-social services.

To effectively serve and manage the computational demands, data center operators have provisioned their infrastructures with accelerators. Specifically for GPUs, support for efficient management lacks, as state-of-the-art schedulers and orchestrators, threat GPUs only as typical compute resources ignoring their unique characteristics and application properties. This phenomenon combined with the GPU over-provisioning problem leads to severe resource under-utilization. Even though prior work has addressed this problem by colocating applications into a single accelerator device, its resource agnostic nature does not manage to face the resource under-utilization and quality of service violations especially for latency critical applications. In this paper, we design a resource aware GPU scheduling framework, able to efficiently colocate applications on the same GPU accelerator card. We integrate our solution with Kubernetes, one of the most widely used cloud orchestration frameworks. We show that our scheduler can achieve 58.8% lower end-to-end job execution time 99%-ile, while delivering 52.5% higher GPU memory usage, 105.9% higher GPU utilization percentage on average and 44.4% lower energy consumption on average, compared to the state-of-the-art schedulers, for a variety of ML representative workloads. © Aggelos Ferikoglou, Dimosthenis Masouros, Achilleas Tzenetopoulos, Sotirios Xydis, and Dimitrios Soudris; licensed under Creative Commons License CC-BY 4.0","Cloud computing; GPU scheduling; Heterogeneity; Kubernetes","Cloud computing; Energy utilization; Graphics processing unit; Information management; Program processors; Quality of service; Cloud-computing; Computational demands; Datacenter; Demand data; Efficient managements; GPU scheduling; Heterogeneity; Kubernetes; Resource aware; State of the art; Scheduling","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115850082"

However, the storage resources of DataNodes are limited and the user demand for data is time-varying, the unreasonable number of data replicas will cause a high storage burden on the file system or low data service quality. Therefore, the number of data replicas needs to be dynamically adjusted according to the actual situation. Based on this, a dynamic replica creation strategy based on the gray Markov chain is proposed. If the number of replicas needs to be increased, the newly added replicas need to be placed on the DataNodes. Considering the problem of load balancing of the DataNode during replica placement, this paper proposes a replica placement strategy based on the Fast Non-dominated Sorting Genetic algorithm. In addition, considering the problem of data replica synchronization and the data recovery of failed DataNodes in the edge cloud system, this paper proposes a delay-adaptive replica synchronization strategy and a load-balancing based replica recovery strategy.

It is widely believed that (micro)service-based architectures can alleviate these problems as each service is supposed to have the following characteristics: clearly defined functionality, sufficient modularity, and the ability to evolve independently. Industrial practices show that service extraction from a legacy monolithic system is labor-intensive and complex. Existing work on service candidate identification aims to group entities of a monolithic system into potential service candidates, but this process has two major challenges: first, it is difficult to extract service candidates with consistent quality; second, it is hard to evaluate the identified service candidates regarding the above three characteristics. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Functionality-oriented Service Candidate Identification (FoSCI) framework to identify service candidates from a monolithic system. Our approach is to record the monolith's execution traces, and extract services candidates using a search-based functional atom grouping algorithm. We also contribute a comprehensive service candidate evaluation suite that uses interface information, structural/conceptual dependency, and commit history.

Several cloud providers (e.g., Amazon, Google, Microsoft) begin to offer native support on their infrastructure by integrating container orchestration tools within their cloud offering. At the same time, the security guarantees that containers offer to applications remain questionable. Customers still need to trust their cloud provider with respect to data and code integrity. The recent introduction by Intel of Software Guard Extensions (SGX) into the mass market offers an alternative to developers, who can now execute their code in a hardware-secured environment without trusting the cloud provider. This paper provides insights regarding the support of SGX inside Kubernetes, an industry-standard container orchestrator.

Among other features, edge computing offers extremely low client/server latencies. To consistently provide such low latencies, services need to run on edge nodes that are physically as close as possible to their clients. Thus, when a client changes its physical location, a service should migrate between edge nodes to maintain proximity. Differently from cloud nodes, edge nodes are built with CPUs of different Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs), hence a server program natively compiled for one ISA cannot migrate to another. This hinders migration to the closest node. We introduce H-Container, which migrates natively-compiled containerized applications across compute nodes featuring CPUs of different ISAs. H-Container advances over existing heterogeneous-ISA migration systems by being a) highly compatible-no source code nor compiler toolchain modifications are needed; b) easily deployable-fully implemented in user space, thus without any OS or hypervisor dependency, and c) largely Linux compliant-can migrate most Linux software, including server applications and dynamically linked binaries. H-Container targets Linux, adopts LLVM, extends CRIU, and integrates with Docker. Experiments demonstrate that H-Container adds no overhead on average during program execution, while between 10ms and 100ms are added during migration. Furthermore, we show the benefits of H-Container in real scenarios, proving for example up to 94% increase in Redis throughput when unlocking heterogeneity. © 2020 ACM.","containers; edge; heterogeneous ISA; migration","Application programs; C (programming language); Containers; Edge computing; Linux; Program processors; Computing paradigm; edge; heterogeneous ISA; Instruction set architecture; migration; Migration systems; Physical locations; Server applications; Computer architecture","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082874168"

They have been extended not only to Linux and Unix-based servers but also to Windows and macOS-based desktops and laptops. Many systems use anti-virus software to minimize damage caused by malware. Most anti-virus software provide real-time malware detection functions and block the execution of malware by enforcing access denial functions for malware that cannot be deleted or for original files that cannot be restored. However, current anti-virus technologies are not designed for container platforms. Therefore, they cannot detect malware in containers in real time; nor can they block malware execution or user access to malware owing to the isolation feature provided by container platforms. To resolve these issues, we propose a functionally-isolated anti-virus architecture for container platforms. The proposed anti-virus architecture separates the functions of a legacy anti-virus engine to ensure compatibility with the isolation features of a container platform. By implementation, it was confirmed that the proposed anti-virus architecture can detect in real-time the entry of malware in a container platform and block the execution of, and user access to unrecoverable malware-infected files. The performance of the proposed functionally-isolated anti-virus architecture is similar to that of legacy anti-virus technology and was verified to be sufficiently effective. © 2013 IEEE.","Anti-virus; container; LXC; malware; real-time detection","Computer system firewalls; Containers; Information services; Windows operating system; Anti virus; Anti-virus engines; Antivirus softwares; Diverse applications; Empirical studies; Malware detection; Real time; User access; Computer viruses","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089303011"

A second layer to analyze the acquired data was used to model water consumption using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

The proper integration of the system elements is the key to the proposed system success. Based on the success of the designed system, it can be applicable on a national scale.

While blockchain may enhance IoT with innate security, data integrity, and autonomous governance, IoT data management and its allocation in blockchain still remain an architectural concern. In this article, we propose a novel context-aware mechanism for on-chain data allocation in IoT-blockchain systems. Specifically, we design a data controller based on fuzzy logic to calculate the Rating of Allocation (RoA) value of each data request considering multiple context parameters, i.e., data, network, and quality and decide its on-chain allocation. Furthermore, we illustrate how the design and realization of the mechanism lead to refinements of two commonly used IoT-blockchain architectural styles (i.e., blockchain-based cloud and fog). To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we instantiate the data allocation mechanism in the blockchain-based cloud and fog architectures and evaluate their performance using FogBus. We also compare the efficacy of our approach to the existing decision-making mechanisms through the deployment of a real-world healthcare application. The experimental results suggest that the realization of the data allocation mechanism improves network usage, latency, and blockchain storage and reduces energy consumption. © 2014 IEEE.","Blockchain; data management; fuzzy logic; Internet of Things (IoT); software architecture styles","Blockchain; Decision making; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Information management; Architectural style; Data allocation; Data controllers; Data integrity; Decision-making mechanisms; Health care application; Internet of Things (IOT); Multiple contexts; Internet of things","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083712966"

KPIs are monitored to assess the achievable performance and to configure various cloud-specific parameters such as flavors of instances and autoscaling rules, among others. Usually, keeping KPIs within acceptable levels requires application expertise which is expensive and can slow down the continuous delivery of software. Expertise is required because KPIs are normally based on application-specific quality-of-service metrics, like service response time and processing rate, instead of generic platform metrics, like those typical across various environments (e.g., CPU and memory utilization, I/O rate, etc.) In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of outsourcing the management of application performance from developers to cloud operators. In the same way that the serverless paradigm allows the execution environment to be fully managed by a third party, we discuss a monitorless model to streamline application deployment by delegating performance management. We show that training a machine learning model with platform-level data, collected from the execution of representative containerized services, allows inferring application KPI degradation. This is an opportunity to simplify operations as engineers can rely solely on platform metrics – while still fulfilling application KPIs – to configure portable and application agnostic rules and other cloud-specific parameters to automatically trigger actions such as autoscaling, instance migration, network slicing, etc. Results show that monitorless infers KPI degradation with an accuracy of 97% and, notably, it performs similarly to typical autoscaling solutions, even when autoscaling rules are optimally tuned with knowledge of the expected workload. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Cloud computing; DevOps; Machine learning; Monitoring","Benchmarking; Cloud computing; Environmental management; Learning systems; Machine learning; Middleware; Monitoring; Outsourcing; Quality of service; Achievable performance; Application deployment; Application performance; DevOps; Key performance indicators; Machine learning models; Performance degradation; Quality of service metrics; Application programs","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078008396"

In the case of IoT industry decision evaluation, the essential problem arises serious incompleteness, impreciseness, subjectivity, and incertitude.

We conduct a multiple-case study in the context of mobility services with three native MSP companies along with an incumbent that is transforming toward an MSP provider.

Containerization has revolutionized data centers from being an infrastructure-oriented to be application oriented. Modern cloud consumption patterns such as flash crowds require a certain amount of elasticity that is realized with controlling the amount of provisioned resources autonomously. Cloud elasticity is significant as it influences the performance of utilized resources, service level commitment, and power consumption. In this paper, an infrastructure elasticity control algorithm for a containerized cloud is proposed. The proposed algorithm augments the load balancing criterion with elasticity control.

For reasons of cost-effectiveness, it is crucial for the elasticity of these web services to match the dynamically-evolving user demand. Traditional approaches employ clusters of virtual machines (VMs) to dynamically scale resources based on application demand. However, they still face challenges such as higher cost due to over-provisioning or incur service level objective (SLO) violations due to under-provisioning. Motivated by this observation, we propose Spock, a new scalable and elastic control system that exploits both VMs and serverless functions to reduce cost and ensure SLO for elastic web services. We show that under two different scaling policies, Spock reduces SLO violations of queries by up to 74\% when compared to VM-based resource procurement schemes. Further, Spock yields significant cost savings, by up to 33\% compared to traditional approaches which use only VMs. © 2019 IEEE.","Autoscaling; Cost-aware; FaaS; Lambda; Serverless; SLO","Cloud computing; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Websites; Autoscaling; Cost-aware; FaaS; Lambda; Serverless; Web services","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069531622"

So far, many systematic reviews have been published in the field of cloud computing, but the fundamental issue is whether these researches are based on a precise process, with a full focus on the issues and challenges of cloud computing, and also have consistent results, or not? Accordingly, in response to this challenge, this research intends to identify, evaluate and synthesize systematic reviews in the field of cloud computing from the methodological and contextual perspectives by conducting a tertiary study for the first time. A systematic review method covering two main steps was used to conduct the research. In the first step, after searching the popular digital libraries between 2011 and 2016, 94 articles were included based on specific criteria. Finally, after qualitative evaluation, 76 papers were qualified using a specific tool. In the second step, based on the thematic synthesis, two main research themes including technology and business in the field of cloud computing were identified and finally, mapping of the concepts and issues related to each area were drawn up and validated using a three-step Delphi method consisting of 12 experts. From the methodological point of view, results of this study showed that over recent years the number and quality of review articles have increased, as well as the use of guidance references and software tools can facilitate the research process. From the contextual perspective, the study also found that the review research has been focused more on technical aspects including cloud security challenges, providing scalable cloud infrastructure according to service levels agreements, and increasing interoperability between services to reduce dependency on cloud vendors. Finally, the study described the need for more review research focusing on business and governance issues of the cloud. © 2019 Iranian Research Institute for Scientific Information and Documentation.

However, Java is a verbose language, thus one of the main drawbacks of the language is that even simple tasks often entail writing a significant amount of code. In some cases, writing too much code might lead to certain code smells, which are violations of fundamental design that can negatively impact the overall quality of programs. To allow programmers to write concise code, JetBrains created a new language named Kotlin. Nevertheless, few studies have evaluated whether Kotlin leads to concise and clearer code in comparison to Java. We conjecture that due to Java's verbosity, programs written in Java are likely to have more code smells than Kotlin programs. Therefore, we set out to evaluate whether some types of code smells are more common in Java programs. To this end, we carried out a large-scale empirical study involving more than 6 million lines of code from programs available in 100 repositories.We found that on average Kotlin programs have less code smells than Java programs. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Bad Smell; Code Smell; Kotlin Language; Refactoring","Codes (symbols); Computer software reusability; Odors; Bad smells; Code smell; Comparative studies; Empirical studies; Fundamental design; Kotlin Language; Overall quality; Refactorings; Java programming language","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055703520"

Therefore, large amounts of sensor data have to be ingested at the server side in order to generate and make the “twin digital model” or virtual factory of the existing physical processes for (among others) predictive simulation and scheduling purposes usable. In this paper, we focus on our ultimate goal, a novel software container-based approach with cloud agnostic orchestration facilities that enable the system operators in the industry to create and manage scalable, virtual IT platforms on-demand for these two typical major pillars of CPS: (1) server-side (i.e., back-end) framework for sensor networks and (2) configurable simulation tool for predicting the behavior of manufacturing systems. The paper discusses the scalability of the applied discrete-event simulation tool and the layered back-end framework starting from simple virtual machine-level to sophisticated multilevel autoscaling use case scenario.

Services are instantiated to users through the environment, appearing and disappearing as they move, which reduces the need for personal communication devices such as smartphones or tablets. To facilitate this development, service architectures need to support virtualized, on-demand service composition based on the hardware and software resources available at the current user location. The technical context for this type of user interaction with digital services through smart surroundings is called Internet of Everything (IoE). Today's service architectures will be too inflexible in this highly decentralized and dynamic environment. Hence, in this article we propose a novel service model called nanoEdge, where nodes collaboratively provide needed functions for virtual services that need to be deployed locally due to performance, efficiency or reliability requirements, for example. The main contributions of this article are the nanoEdge conceptual model and its proof-of-concept (PoC) implementation to show that the model is feasible with regard to performance and resource-efficiency.

For this, it is necessary to plan strategies for deployment and relocation of processes; but always taking into account hardware repercussions and the knowledge of the architecture and applications behavior. On the other hand, it has already been demonstrated that the use of microservices brings numerous advantages in availability and efficiency; but we do not find many jobs that exploit this technique on the energy level.

These approaches, however, sometimes reduce the rate so substantially as to make the health state of the network opaque. One solution is to include a regular heartbeat transmission whose receipt or otherwise informs the sink about the health state of the node. However, given that a large period increases the probability that dead nodes go unnoticed at the sink, while a small period likely increases the energy cost of communication, what should be the period of the heartbeat transmission? In this paper, we examine the use of heartbeats in WSN design. We derive a general protocol for optimal and dynamic heartbeat transmission by minimising the Bayes risk, which is the expected cost of missing data from dead nodes plus the energy cost of heartbeat transmissions. Our proposed algorithm is dynamic in the sense that the heartbeat period is updated as time goes on and node failures become more probable. We validate our design experimentally using three real-world datasets, and show a 36% reduction in the total heartbeat operational cost over a heartbeat transmission with a fixed period; the results also highlight the superiority of our algorithm over arbitrarily chosen heartbeat periods in different WSN settings, thus promising significant cost savings in WSN applications. © 2019","Edge mining; Failure detection; Heartbeat transmission; Internet of things; Wireless sensor networks","Internet of things; Power management (telecommunication); Wireless sensor networks; Energy aware; Expected costs; Failure detection; Fixed period; Model-based prediction; Real-world datasets; Transmission rates; Wsn applications; Sensor nodes","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063476363"

Using methods like virtualization, adopting architectures based on microservices, automation of building and deployment processes, Cloud could provide on-demand resources and scale them accordingly to a Service Level Agreement (SLA). Even if there are a lot of Cloud computing providers (like Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, IBM, Google etc.), many of them providing advanced services, already deployed technologies, auto-scaling and monitoring tools, on the long run a private Cloud could cost less than a public Cloud. On the other hand, a private Cloud has the disadvantage of lacking hardware resources for scaling an unexpected spike of usage or periodical growths in the number of requests. This problem could be solved using a public Cloud provider API for extending the hardware by buying and selling resources, using a pay-per-use or a pay-as-you-go model. This paper describes and evaluates a private Cloud architecture capable of on demand deployment of microservices based applications, monitoring every instance using CPU, memory, networking and disk data collectors' software, monitoring every task queue and horizontally auto-scaling the number of instances per service. Using Cloud monitoring data, SLA and budget constraints we decide if a new instance should be spawned or terminated in the private Cloud or in a public Cloud. From the customer point of view the process of auto-scaling across the hybrid Cloud is transparent, but requires a horizontally scalable service. We will illustrate our work running an application packaged as microservices in containers in a Kubernetes private Cloud that will be extended using public resources from AWS. The results of the paper offers an architectural model that can be used to build an in-house, scalable Cloud. © 2018 ACM.","Auto-scalability; Cloud computing; Microservices; Queuing theory; Task scheduling","Application programs; Budget control; Cloud computing; Computation theory; Hardware; Queueing theory; Scalability; Windows operating system; Architectural modeling; Deployment process; Hardware resources; Internet based computing; Microservices; Queuing theory; Service Level Agreement (SLA); Task-scheduling; Computer architecture","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050572319"

In order to reduce the pressure on the network caused by the long distance between the processing platform and the terminal, edge computing provides a new paradigm for IoT applications. In many scenarios, the IoT devices are distributed in remote areas or extreme terrain and cannot be accessed directly through the terrestrial network, and data transmission can only be achieved via satellite. However, traditional satellites are highly customized, and on-board resources are designed for specific applications rather than universal computing. Therefore, we propose to transform the traditional satellite into a space edge computing node. It can dynamically load software in orbit, flexibly share on-board resources, and provide services coordinated with the cloud. The corresponding hardware structure and software architecture of the satellite is presented. Through the modeling analysis and simulation experiments of the application scenarios, the results show that the space edge computing system takes less time and consumes less energy than the traditional satellite constellation.

However, most of these emerging assistants rely on-partly similar-data-driven analyses that are independent of each other, leading to redundancy issues. In this paper, we propose a novel concept (termed AssistantGraph) for an efficient design and runtime support of digital assistants. More specifically, assistants need to represent their data-driven processing pipelines as a directed acyclic graph of assistant components (modularity) to benefit from serverless computing with data access. Facilitated component sharing across assistants (reusability) leads to a more connected and efficient overall graph: a shared component instance requires to run only once; versioned components are enabled by the proposed backward chains of converters (versioning). We further develop data and control flow mechanisms through recursive filtering on demand to trigger the data-driven components as required. Within a novel proposed and prototypically implemented open assistant infrastructure, we evaluate our concept in terms of feasibility and performance. The results show reduced redundancy with simultaneous significant performance gains (through component sharing) despite minimal additional overhead (due to modularization and backward compatibility). We believe that our approach gives a new perspective on data-driven assistants and complements an open assistant ecosystem. © 2019 IEEE.","Data-driven analytics; FaaS; Operation graph; Serverless computing; Ubiquitous personal assistant; Versioning","Application programs; Directed graphs; Modular construction; Redundancy; Reusability; Ubiquitous computing; Data driven; FaaS; Operation graph; Personal assistants; Serverless computing; Versioning; Data handling","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072702778"

This paper aims at proposing a scalable architecture to provide real-time context-aware actions based on predictive streaming processing of data as an evolution of a previously provided event-driven service-oriented architecture which already permitted the context-aware detection and notification of relevant data.

As a result, our architecture has been enhanced twofold: on the one hand, the architecture has been supplied with reliable predictions through the use of predictive analytics and complex event processing techniques, which permit the notification of relevant context-aware information ahead of time.

The cyber-physical systems (CPSs) monitor and control the things from the distance. As a result, the concepts of dependability and security get deeply intertwined. The increasing level of dynamicity, heterogeneity, and complexity adds to the system's vulnerability, and challenges its ability to react to faults. This paper summarizes the state of the art of existing work on anomaly detection, fault-tolerance, and self-healing, and adds a number of other methods applicable to achieve resilience in an IoT. We particularly focus on non-intrusive methods ensuring data integrity in the network. Furthermore, this paper presents the main challenges in building a resilient IoT for the CPS, which is crucial in the era of smart CPS with enhanced connectivity (an excellent example of such a system is connected autonomous vehicles). It further summarizes our solutions, work-in-progress and future work to this topic to enable 'Trustworthy IoT for CPS'.

Major evolutions have happened beginning with basic architecture relying on initiated request by a client to a processing side referred to as the server. Such architectures were not enough to cope up with the fast ever-increasing number of requests and need to utilize network bandwidth. Mobile agents attempted to overcome such drawbacks but did cope up for so long with the growing technology platforms. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) then evolved to be one of the most successful representations of the client-server architecture with an added business value that provides reusable and loosely coupled services. SOA did not meet customers and business expectations as it was still relying on monolithic systems. Resilience, scalability, fast software delivery and the use of fewer resources are highly desirable features. Microservices architecture came to fulfil those expectations of system development, yet it comes with many challenges. This paper illustrates how distributed systems evolved from the traditional client-server model to the recently proposed microservices architecture.

First, some publications relevant to the service computing systems are reviewed systematically in order to develop fundamental concepts and elements of the systems. Second, a metamodel of service computing systems is built based on those concepts. Third, the life cycle model of service computing systems engineering is proposed based on the metamodel. Finally, the verification of the life cycle is conducted by comparing the proposed life cycle to the life cycle of software engineering, service engineering, and service system engineering.

The proposed platform uses the features available in the 5G design such as MEC, caching and CRAN. An optimization problem with the objective of minimization of average latency is defined and resolved.

By offloading suitable microservices to the SmartNIC’s low-power processor, we can improve server energy-efficiency without latency loss. However, as a heterogeneous computing substrate in the data path of the host, SmartNICs bring several challenges to a microservice platform: network traffic routing and load balancing, microservice placement on heterogeneous hardware, and contention on shared SmartNIC resources. We present E3, a microservice execution platform for SmartNIC-accelerated servers. E3 follows the design philosophies of the Azure Service Fabric microservice platform and extends key system components to a SmartNIC to address the above-mentioned challenges. E3 employs three key techniques: ECMP-based load balancing via SmartNICs to the host, network topology-aware microservice placement, and a data-plane orchestrator that can detect SmartNIC overload. Our E3 prototype using Cavium LiquidIO SmartNICs shows that SmartNIC offload can improve cluster energy-efficiency up to 3× and cost efficiency up to 1.9× at up to 4% latency cost for common microservices, including real-time analytics, an IoT hub, and virtual network functions. © Proceedings of the 2019 USENIX Annual Technical Conference, USENIX ATC 2019.

This wide variety of scenarios creates different challenges such as the heterogeneity of IoT devices, support for large numbers of connected devices, reliable and safe systems, energy efficiency and the possibility of using this system by third-parties in other scenarios. A transversal middleware in all IoT solutions is called an IoT platform. the IoT platform is a piece of software that works like a kind of “glue” to combine platforms and orchestrate capabilities that connect devices, users and applications/services in a “cyber-physical” world. In this way, the IoT platform can help solve the challenges listed above. This paper proposes an IoT agnostic architecture, highlighting the role of the IoT platform, within a broader ecosystem of interconnected tools, aiming at increasing scalability, stability, interoperability and reusability. For that purpose, different paradigms of computing will be used, such as microservices architecture and serverless computing. Additionally, a technological proposal of the architecture, called SEnviro Connect, is presented. This proposal is validated in the IoT scenario of smart farming, where five IoT devices (SEnviro nodes) have been deployed to improve wine production.

Finally, we show examples of using our model for offline regression analysis to detect critical issues before their deployment. © 2018 IEEE.","Capacity Management; Capacity Planning; Cloud Computing; Data Center; Distributed Systems; Micro Service; Online Service; Optimization; Resource Usage; Server Pool","Cloud computing; Information management; Online systems; Optimization; Regression analysis; Capacity management; Capacity planning; Data centers; Distributed systems; Micro services; On-line service; Resource usage; Distributed computer systems","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050956874"

Various algorithms have been proposed in order to reduce the total number of required servers and network devices. The practice developed in response to the problem of server sprawl, a situation in which multiple, under-utilized servers (and/or network devices) take up more space and consume more resources than can be justified by their workload; with the effect to power off unused equipment. Generally, consolidation mechanisms consider different parameters related to the services neglecting the specific function of the Virtual Machines (VMs) in the application framework (e.g., core component, backup replica, member of a set of workers for load balancing). In this work, we developed a new consolidation algorithm that takes into account the particular function of each VM with the aim to apply power saving mechanisms without compromising the desired service level. The results of the simulations show that it is possible to obtain significant values of energy saving. In particular, we show, with different heuristics, the optimal trade-off between service level and power efficiency achieved by the proposed model. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Cloud applications; Consolidation; Energy-aware; Green; Heuristics; Optimization; Virtual machines","Consolidation; Digital communication systems; Economic and social effects; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Network security; Optimization; Power management; Virtual machine; Application frameworks; Cloud applications; Consolidation mechanisms; Efficient strategy; Energy aware; Green; Heuristics; Power saving mechanism; Green computing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85030153378"

We show that these ""killer microsecond"" service times can cause state-of-the-art dynamic power management techniques to break down, due to short idle period length and low power state transition overheads. In this paper, we propose ìDPM, a dynamic power management scheme for the microsecond era that coordinates request delaying, per-core sleep states, and voltage frequency scaling. The idea is to postpone the wake up of a CPU as long as possible and then adjust the frequency so that the tail latency constraint of requests are satisfied just-in-time. μDPM reduces processor energy consumption by up to 32% and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by 2x. © 2019 IEEE.","DVFS; Dynamic power management; Sleep states","Dynamic frequency scaling; Energy utilization; Supercomputers; DVFS; Dynamic power management; Latency constraints; Low power state; Sleep state; State of the art; State-of-the-art techniques; Voltage frequency; Memory architecture","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064221155"

It proposes four basic relations of unity of opposites in computer science (i.e., four basic scientific problems), which include: the positioning of centralization and decentralization, the interaction of hardness and softness, supply-demand correspondence and serial-to-parallel conversion. From the perspective of the positioning of centralization and decentralization, eighteen stratagems of architecture design are proposed in the thirty-six stratagems of algorithms, which include the stratagems of time-space transformation and various computing modes. From the perspective of the interaction of hardness and softness, eighteen stratagems of system features are proposed in the thirty-six stratagems of schemes, which include the stratagems of designing eight kinds of features, such as controllability, efficiency, security and variability. The scientific problems involved in supply-demand correspondence and serial-to-parallel conversion are mainly embodied in the thirty-six stratagems of algorithms for resource management and task scheduling. These algorithms and schemes include classic and hot issues in computer science, such as computability, multi-objective optimization, cloud computing, software defined system, big data thinking and artificial intelligence. The thirty-six stratagems of schemes and thirty-six stratagems of algorithms can provide computer professionals with thinking framework, dialectical thinking and necessary stratagems and instances in learning and developing computer systems.

The latency profle of these multi-stage applications is intrinsically variable, making it challenging to provide satisfactory responsiveness. Given a limited power budget, improving the end-to-end latency requires intelligently boosting the bottleneck service across stages using multiple boosting techniques. However, prior work fail to acknowledge the multi-stage nature of user-facing applications and perform poorly in improving responsiveness on power constrained CMP, as they are unable to accurately identify bottleneck service and apply the boosting techniques adaptively. In this paper, we present PowerChief, a runtime framework that 1) provides joint design of service and query to monitor the latency statistics across service stages and accurately identifes the bottleneck service during runtime; 2) adaptively chooses the boosting technique to accelerate the bottleneck service with improved responsiveness; 3) dynamically reallocates the constrained power budget across service stages to accommodate the chosen boosting technique. Evaluated with real world multi-stage applications, PowerChief improves the average latency by 20.3× and 32.4× (99% tail latency by 13.3× and 19.4×) for Sirius and Natural Language Processing applications respectively compared to stage-agnostic power allocation. In addition, for the given QoS target, PowerChief reduces the power consumption of Sirius and Web Search applications by 23% and 33% respectively over prior work. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Intelligent Service Boosting; Multi-Stage Application; Power Constrained CMP","Budget control; Facings; Natural language processing systems; Quality of service; End to end latencies; Intelligent Services; Multi stage; Multiple processing; Number of services; Power allocations; Power Constrained CMP; Runtime frameworks; Computer architecture","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85025619452"

Power demand is characterized by different heating cycles including sequences of various transient and steady-state phases. To effectively perform the predictive task by exploiting the huge amount of fine-grained energy-related data collected through Internet of Things (IoT) devices, innovative and scalable solutions should be devised. This paper presents PHI-CIB, a scalable full-stack distributed engine, addressing all tasks from energy-related data collection, to their integration, storage, analysis, and modeling. Heterogeneous data measurements (e.g., power consumption in buildings, meteorological conditions) are collected through multiple hardware (e.g., IoT devices) and software (e.g., web services) entities. Such data are integrated and analyzed to predict the average power demand of each building for different time horizons. First, the transient and steady-state phases characterizing the heating cycle of each building are automatically identified; then the power-level forecasting is performed for each phase. To this aim, PHI-CIB relies on a pipeline of three algorithms: the ExponentiallyWeighted Moving Average, the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline, and the Linear Regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent. PHI-CIB’s current implementation exploits Apache Spark and MongoDB and supports parallel and scalable processing and analytical tasks. Experimental results, performed on energy-related data collected in a real-world system show the effectiveness of PHI-CIB in predicting heating power consumption of buildings with a limited prediction error and an optimal horizontal scalability. © 2019 by the authors.

In IoT environments, connected things generate a huge amount of data, which are generally referred to as big data. Data generated from IoT devices are generally processed in a cloud infrastructure because of the on-demand services and scalability features of the cloud computing paradigm. However, processing IoT application requests on the cloud exclusively is not an efficient solution for some IoT applications, especially time-sensitive ones. To address this issue, Fog computing, which resides in between cloud and IoT devices, was proposed. In general, in the Fog computing environment, IoT devices are connected to Fog devices. These Fog devices are located in close proximity to users and are responsible for intermediate computation and storage. One of the key challenges in running IoT applications in a Fog computing environment are resource allocation and task scheduling. Fog computing research is still in its infancy, and taxonomy-based investigation into the requirements of Fog infrastructure, platform, and applications mapped to current research is still required. This survey will help the industry and research community synthesize and identify the requirements for Fog computing. This paper starts with an overview of Fog computing in which the definition of Fog computing, research trends, and the technical differences between Fog and cloud are reviewed. Then, we investigate numerous proposed Fog computing architectures and describe the components of these architectures in detail. From this, the role of each component will be defined, which will help in the deployment of Fog computing. Next, a taxonomy of Fog computing is proposed by considering the requirements of the Fog computing paradigm. We also discuss existing research works and gaps in resource allocation and scheduling, fault tolerance, simulation tools, and Fog-based microservices. Finally, by addressing the limitations of current research works, we present some open issues, which will determine the future research direction for the Fog computing paradigm. © 2013 IEEE.","fault tolerance; Fog computing; fog devices; Internet of Things (IoT); IoT application; microservices","Architecture; Big data; Computer architecture; Digital storage; Fault tolerance; Fog; Internet of things; Multitasking; Resource allocation; Surveys; Taxonomies; Allocation and scheduling; Computing architecture; Computing environments; Future research directions; Internet of thing (IOT); Internet of Things (IOT); IOT applications; Microservices; Fog computing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052713522"

However, a service oriented architecture (SOA) is difficult to provide scalable and extensible services in a city-wide distributed Internet of Things (IoT)-based SPS system. Furthermore, traditional management and security solutions rely on a centralized authority, which can be the performance bottleneck or single point of failure. Inspired by the microservices architecture and blockchain technology, a Lightweight IoT based Smart Public Safety (LISPS) framework is proposed on top of a permissioned blockchain network. Through decoupling a monolithic complex system into independent sub-tasks, the LISPS system possesses high flexibility in the design process and online maintenance.

The adequate usage of this data may increase the impact of and improve the healthcare service quality; however, the quality of the data may be questionable. Assessing the quality of the data for the task in hand may reduce the associated risks, and increase the confidence of the data usability. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, this paper presents the web objects based contextual data quality assessment model with enhanced classification metric parameters. A semantic ontology of virtual objects, composite virtual objects, and services is also proposed for the parameterization of contextual data quality assessment of web objects data. The novelty of this article is the provision of contextual data quality assessment mechanisms at the data acquisition, assessment, and service level for the web objects enabled semantic data applications. To evaluate the proposed data quality assessment mechanism, web objects enabled affective stress and teens' mood care semantic data applications are designed, and a deep data quality learning model is developed. The findings of the proposed approach reveal that, once a data quality assessment model is trained on web objects enabled healthcare semantic data, it could be used to classify the incoming data quality in various contextual data quality metric parameters. Moreover, the data quality assessment mechanism presented in this paper can be used to other application domains by incorporating data quality analysis requirements ontology. © 2020 by authors.","Data quality assessment; Healthcare applications; Semantic data; Web of objects","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082715795"

The ad-hoc nature of the network architecture and the low power connectivity features of the IIoT help observe, model, optimize and control processes, machines as well as the whole manufacturing enterprise remotely and cost-effectively, which means more integration with the real world and less human intervention. The IIoT interface helps people and system components communicate at the right time and place at a reasonable cost, from product conception to service providing. For industries, the IIoT has revolutionized the fields of machine learning, big data technology, sensory networks and machine-to-machine (M2M) communications. That has improved the overall manufacturing system performance and made them more sustainable than ever, by monitoring their power consumption and waste. In this paper, a brief introduction of the current development of IIoT is presented focusing on the digital factory, the cyber-physical system and the Industry 4.0 paradigms. The current challenges and limitations of IIoT and cyber manufacturing systems, such as economic impact, architectural patterns and infrastructures are discussed. In addition, the future opportunities of IIoT integration in sustainable manufacturing are investigated, showing the gaps in the technology and models to achieve the triple-bottom-line (TBL) of sustainability while getting closer to the full potential of the IIoT implementation in the new Industry 4.0 paradigm. © Copyright© (2018) by American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM).

In this article, we introduce a new algorithm KaliGreen that can maneuver the microservices within a network of devices in order to maximize the run-time of a microservice-based application; moreover, KaliGreen allows a 54% increase in the average run-time of an application by shifting microservices from 6 devices (as example) with low battery or inefficient processing ratios to devices in better conditions. To achieve this, KaliGreen utilizes KaliMucho middleware, which is able manipulate microservices in run-time.

All these factors may affect the system quality and generate negative consequences, such as delays and system failures. The identification of bad practices leading to performance flaws is of key relevance to avoid expensive rework in redesign, reimplementation, and redeployment. Objective: The goal of this manuscript is to provide a systematic process, based on load testing and profiling data, to identify performance issues with runtime data. These performance issues represent an important source of knowledge as they are used to trigger the software refactoring process. Software characteristics and performance measurements are matched with well-known performance antipatterns to document common performance issues and their solutions. Method: We execute load testing based on the characteristics of collected operational profile, thus to produce representative workloads. Performance data from the system under test is collected using a profiler tool to create profiler snapshots and get performance hotspot reports. From such data, performance issues are identified and matched with the specification of antipatterns. Software refactorings are then applied to solve these performance antipatterns. Results: The approach has been applied to a real-world industrial case study and to a representative laboratory study. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool-supported approach that is able to automatically detect two performance antipatterns by exploiting the knowledge of domain experts.

Today's network operators are faced with securing 100Gbps networks with 100K+ concurrent connections by deploying IDS/IPSes to search for 10K+ rules concurrently. In this paper we set an ambitious goal: Can we do all of the above in a single server? Through the Pigasus IDS/IPS, we show that this goal is achievable, perhaps for the first time, by building on recent advances in FPGA-capable SmartNICs. Pigasus' design takes an FPGA-first approach, where the majority of processing, and all state and control flow are managed on the FPGA. However, doing so requires careful design of algorithms and data structures to ensure fast common-case performance while densely utilizing system memory resources. Our experiments with a variety of traces show that Pigasus can support 100Gbps using an average of 5 cores and 1 FPGA, using 38× less power than a CPU-only approach. © 2020 Proceedings of the 14th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation, OSDI 2020.

The value of the container market is expected to reach $2.7 billion in 2020 as compared to $762 million in 2016. Although they are considered the standardized method for microservices deployment, playing an important role in cloud computing emerging fields such as service meshes, market surveys show that container security is the main concern and adoption barrier for many companies. In this paper, we survey the literature on container security and solutions. We have derived four generalized use cases that should cover security requirements within the host-container threat landscape. The use cases include: (I) protecting a container from applications inside it, (II) inter-container protection, (III) protecting the host from containers, and (IV) protecting containers from a malicious or semi-honest host. We found that the first three use cases utilize a software-based solutions that mainly rely on Linux kernel features (e.g., namespaces, CGroups, capabilities, and seccomp) and Linux security modules (e.g., AppArmor). The last use case relies on hardware-based solutions such as trusted platform modules (TPMs) and trusted platform support (e.g., Intel SGX). We hope that our analysis will help researchers understand container security requirements and obtain a clearer picture of possible vulnerabilities and attacks.

Given predesigned standard microservices with respect to specific data processing logics, the proposed platform is expected to largely reduce the complexity in and relieve inexperienced practices of IoBDA implementations. The potential contributions to the relevant communities include (1) new theories of a microservice-oriented platform on top of SDI and (2) a functional microservice-oriented platform for IoBDA with a group of predesigned microservices. © 2019 by the authors.

System dependability has been of the upmost importance and criticality to both service vendors and customers. Security, a measurable attribute, is increasingly regarded as the representative example of dependability. Literally, with the increment of microservice types and dynamicity, applications are exposed to aggravated internal security threats and externally environmental uncertainties. Existing work mainly focuses on the QoS-aware composition of native VM-based Cloud application components, while ignoring uncertainties and security risks among interactive and interdependent container-based microservices. Still, orchestrating a set of microservices across datacenters under those constraints remains computationally intractable. This paper describes a new dependable microservice orchestration framework GA-Par to effectively select and deploy microservices whilst reducing the discrepancy between user security requirements and actual service provision. We adopt a hybrid (both whitebox and blackbox based) approach to measure the satisfaction of security requirement and the environmental impact of network QoS on system dependability. Due to the exponential grow of solution space, we develop a parallel Genetic Algorithm framework based on Spark to accelerate the operations for calculating the optimal or near-optimal solution. Large-scale real world datasets are utilized to validate models and orchestration approach. Experiments show that our solution outperforms the greedy-based security aware method with 42.34 percent improvement. GA-Par is roughly 4x faster than a Hadoop-based genetic algorithm solver and the effectiveness can be constantly guaranteed under different application scales. © 1990-2012 IEEE.","dependability; microservice; Service orchestration","Environmental impact; Large dataset; Quality of service; dependability; Environmental uncertainty; microservice; Near-optimal solutions; Parallel genetic algorithms; Security requirements; Service orchestration; System dependability; Genetic algorithms","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077089009"

Microservice-based applications (μApps) rely on message passing for communication and to decouple each microservice, allowing the logic in each service to scale independently. Complex μApps can contain hundreds of microservices, complicating the ability of DevOps engineers to reason about and automatically optimize the deployment. In particular, the performance and resource utilization of a μApp depends on the placement of the microservices that compose it. However, existing tools for μApps, like Kubernetes, provide minimal ability to influence the placement and utilization of a μApp deployment. In this paper, we first identify the runtime aspects of microservice execution that impact the placement of microservices in a μApp. We then review the challenges of reconfiguring a μApp based on these aspects. Our main contribution is an adaptation mechanism, named REMaP, to manage the placement of microservices in an μApp automatically. To achieve this, REMaP uses microservice affinities and resource usage history. We evaluate our REMaP prototype and demonstrate that our solution is autonomic, lowers resource utilization, and can substantially improve μApp performance. © 2019, The Author(s).","Microservices; Optimization; Runtime adaptation","Internet; Optimization; Adaptation mechanism; Cloud-based applications; Microservices; Resource usage; Resource utilizations; Runtime adaptation; Runtimes; Message passing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062150526"

Given documented discrepancies between the design and operation of buildings, concepts such as continuous commissioning and performance testing (PTing) have emerged. To increase the applicability and customizability of real-Time performance monitoring, PTing frameworks utilize metadata schemas and generic libraries of tests. However, real-Time PTing requires enhanced instrumentation in the building, such as meters and sensors. Considering the usage and age of buildings, different buildings impose more stringent requirements for sensing equipment in terms of applicability of PTing. Prior work establishes a framework for automatic discovery of performance tests, and their continuous execution without human intervention. In this paper, we provide an algorithm for automatic estimation of the Smart Readiness Indicator (SRI), a metric for measuring the technological readiness of a building proposed by the European Commission.

Whereas, computational offloading needs the mobile application to be partitioned during the execution in the MCC so that total execution cost is minimized. In the MCC, at the run-time network contexts (i.e., network bandwidth, signal strength, latency, etc.) are intermittently changed, and transient failures (due to temporary network connection failure, services busy, database disk out of storage) often occur for a short period of time. Therefore, transient failure aware partitioning of the mobile application at run-time is a challenging task. Since, existing MCC offers computational monolithic services by exploiting heavyweight virtual machines, which incurs with long VM startup time and high overhead, and these cannot meet the requirements of fine-grained microservices applications (e.g., E-healthcare, E-business, 3D-Game, and Augmented Reality). To cope up with prior issues, we propose microservices based mobile cloud platform by exploiting containerization which replaces heavyweight virtual machines, and we propose the application partitioning task assignment (APTA) algorithm which determines application partitioning at run-time and adopts the fault aware (FA) policy to execute microservices applications robustly without interruption in the MCC. Simulation results validate that the proposed microservices mobile cloud platform not only shrinks the setup time of run-time platform but also reduce the energy consumption of nodes and improve the application response time by exploiting APTA and FA to the existing VM based MCC and application partitioning strategies. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Application partitioning; Application programming interface (API); APTA; FA; Microservices; Min-cut; Mobile cloudlet computing; Offloadi ng; Representational state transfer (REST)","Application programming interfaces (API); Augmented reality; Energy utilization; Green computing; Interface states; mHealth; Mobile computing; Network security; Simulation platform; Virtual machine; Application partitioning; APTA; Microservices; Min-cut; Mobile cloudlet computing; Offloadi ng; Representational state transfer; Mobile cloud computing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067040812"

Various algorithms have been proposed in order to reduce the total number of required servers and network devices. The practice developed in response to the problem of server sprawl, a situation in which multiple, under-utilized servers (and/or network devices) take up more space and consume more resources than the ones justified by their workload; with the effect to power off unused equipment. Generally, consolidation mechanisms consider different parameters related to the services neglecting the specific function of the Virtual Machines (VMs) in the application framework (e.g., core component, backup replica, member of a set of workers for load balancing). In this work, we develop a new consolidation algorithm that takes into account the particular function of each VM with the aim to apply power saving mechanisms without compromising the desired service level. The results of the simulations show that it is possible to obtain significant energy savings. In particular, we show, with different heuristics, the optimal trade-off between service level and power efficiency achieved by the proposed model. © 2017 ITC Press.","","Economic and social effects; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Power management; Application frameworks; Cloud applications; Consolidation mechanisms; Core components; Efficient strategy; Network devices; Power efficiency; Power saving mechanism; Green computing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040237525"

Supported by edge computing technology, data acquisition can also support more complex and perfect application requirements in industrial field. Most of traditional sampling methods use constant sampling frequency and ignore the impact of changes of sampling objects during the data acquisition. For the problem of sampling distortion, edge data redundancy and energy consumption caused by constant sampling frequency of sensors in the IIoT, a data-driven adaptive sampling method based on edge computing is proposed in this paper. The method uses the latest data collected by the sensors at the edge node for linear fitting and adjusts the next sampling frequency according to the linear median jitter sum and adaptive sampling strategy. An edge data acquisition platform is established to verify the validity of the method. According to the experimental results, the proposed method is more effective than other adaptive sampling methods. Compared with constant sampling frequency, the proposed method can reduce the edge data redundancy and energy consumption by more than 13.92% and 12.86%, respectively. © 2020 by the authors.

The proliferation of social media and domotics urges a new kind of ubiquity where different kinds of features are deployed everywhere atop of the everyday life small devices and even embedded in our surroundings. While we measure the opportunities offered by such advancements in improving people lifestyles and obtaining immediate and useful services, it is necessary to consider the real impact on our privacy. Recently, a newly adopted European standard, the General Data Protection Regulation aims at codifying the rules of personal data use. We strongly believe in the necessity for a Smart City of adopting such privacy regulation while benefiting at the same time from new services, in a generic and easy way. In that sense, we build an approach that is at the frontier of the cryptoscience domain for a better privacy and the Micro Service-Oriented Architectures for an increased use by tiers. Indeed, our service is accessible in a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) manner and uses encryption to ensure data privacy. The particularity of our system lies in the fact that the server performs a classification algorithm without any information about the sensitive data and without the capability to decrypt it. The underlying cryptographic technology used is homomorphic encryption, allowing to perform calculations directly on encrypted data. Our service is generic by design and could be applied over several metrics. We adopt an energy efficiency use case and propose a service for buildings energy diagnosis and classification towards renovations and/or reductions of the electric consumption. We showcase our prototype of crypto-classification service by involving different actors of a Smart City community.

This disrupts the remote Cloud Computing model, moving applications, data and computing resources to the logical extremes of the network. Thus, to handle streaming data in IoT environments, an efficient IoT-based computing model that can dynamically handle the interplay between Cloud and Edge data centers is required. In this direction, a recent paradigm, popularly known as Osmotic Computing, has emerged to ensure the acceptable performance of widely dispersed services. However, the burden of data-offloading across multiple data centers usually leads to a consequent increase in their energy consumption which in-turn will affect the overall Quality of Service (QoS) of the IoT-based applications. Keeping focus on all these issues, a consolidated decision making framework for Osmotic Computing, i.e., En-OsCo, is designed to ensure the energy-aware dynamic management of resources. The proposed framework incorporates four significant contributions: i) Resource monitoring of Edge data centers using Extended Kalman Filter, ii) Optimal dispatch of incoming services to the Edge/Cloud setup using Hyper-heuristics, iii) Minimizing the energy consumption of underlying data centers and reducing the service latency, and iv) Reducing the search space of Hyper-heuristics by keeping track of previously made decisions using Universal Streaming Monitoring. Further, in order to validate the efficacy of the proposed En-OsCo framework, ContainerCloudSim has been used in combination of HyFlex on PlanetLab datasets. The obtained results validate the purpose of the proposed scheme in minimizing the overall energy consumption of the computing setup while considerably reducing the latency. © 2019 ACM.","And osmotic computing; Cloud computing; Edge computing; Energy minimization; Extended kalman filter; Hyper-heuristics; Latency minimization","Cloud computing; Data reduction; Decision making; Edge computing; Energy utilization; Extended Kalman filters; Green computing; Heuristic methods; Osmosis; Power management; Quality of service; Acceptable performance; And osmotic computing; Cloud-based applications; Computing frameworks; Decision-making frameworks; Energy minimization; Hyper-heuristics; Internet of thing (IOT); Internet of things","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071922408"

It decomposes monolithic software into a set of loosely coupled containerized microservices and associates them into multiple microservice chains to serve service requests. The new architecture creates flexibility for service provisioning but also introduces increased energy consumption and low service performance. Efficient resource allocation is critical. Unfortunately, existing solutions are designed at a coarse level for virtual machine (VM)-based clouds and not optimized for such chain-oriented service provisioning. In this paper, we study the resource allocation optimization problem for service request routing and microservice instance placement, so as to jointly reduce both resource usage and chains’ end-to-end response time for saving energy and guaranteeing Quality of Service (QoS). We design detailed workload models for microservices and chains and formulate the optimization problem as a bi-criteria optimization problem. To address it, a three-stage scheme is proposed to search and optimize the trade-off decisions, route service requests into instances and deploy instances to servers in a balanced manner. Through numerical evaluations, we show that while assuring the same QoS, our scheme performs significantly better than and faster than benchmarking algorithms on reducing energy consumption and balancing load. © 2019","Bi-criteria optimization; Energy consumption; Load balance; Microservice; Microservice chain; QoS","Balancing; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Optimization; Resource allocation; Benchmarking algorithm; Bicriteria optimization; Efficient resource allocation; End-to-end response time; Load balance; Microservice; Reducing energy consumption; Resource allocation optimization; Quality of service","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072519087"

Serverless cloud services provide fine-grained provisioning of resources, which scale automatically with user demand. Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) applications follow this serverless model, with the developer providing their application as a set of functions which are executed in response to a user- or system-generated event. Functions are designed to be short-lived and execute inside containers or virtual machines, introducing a range of system-level overheads. This paper studies the architectural implications of this emerging paradigm. Using the commercial-grade Apache OpenWhisk FaaS platform on real servers, this work investigates and identifies the architectural implications of FaaS serverless computing. The workloads, along with the way that FaaS inherently interleaves short functions from many tenants frustrates many of the locality-preserving architectural structures common in modern processors. In particular, we find that: FaaS containerization brings up to 20x slowdown compared to native execution, cold-start can be over 10x a short function's execution time, branch mispredictions per kilo-instruction are 20x higher for short functions, memory bandwidth increases by 6x due to the invocation pattern, and IPC decreases by as much as 35% due to inter-function interference.

SDHI builds upon the concept of hardware (HW) resource disaggregation. HW resource disaggregation breaks today's physical server-oriented model where the use of a physical resource (e.g., processor or memory) is constrained to a physical server's chassis. SDHI extends the definition of of software-defined infrastructures (SDI) and brings greater modularity, flexibility, and extensibility to cloud infrastructures, thus allowing cloud operators to employ resources more efficiently and allowing applications not to be bounded by the physical infrastructure's layout. This paper aims to be an initial introduction to SDHI and its associated technological advancements. This paper starts with an overview of the cloud domain and puts into perspective some of the most prominent efforts in the area. Then, it presents a set of differentiating use-cases that SDHI enables. Next, we state the fundamentals behind SDI and SDHI, and elaborate why SDHI is of great interest today. Moreover, it provides an overview of the functional architecture of a cloud built on SDHI, exploring how the impact of this transformation goes far beyond the cloud infrastructure level in its impact on platforms, execution environments, and applications. Finally, an in-depth assessment is made of the technologies behind SDHI, the impact of these technologies, and the associated challenges and potential future directions of SDHI. © 1998-2012 IEEE.","cloud infrastructure; CR-software-defined infrastructure; disaggregated DC; hyperscale computing; rack-scale; resource disaggregation","Computer hardware; Hardware; Cloud infrastructures; Disaggregated DC; Disaggregation; Hyperscale Computing; Rack-scale; Application programs","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046804138"

At today, around 75% of global energy is consumed in urban areas, so efforts must be addressed to transform existing urban energy systems into more sustainable systems. In this perspective, a key aspect to evolve toward a cleaner and affordable energy system is the development of Multi-Energy Systems (MES) modelling, whereby heat, electricity, fuels, transport, and other energy carriers closely interact with each other at various scales. MES can optimize technical, economic and environmental performance with respect to “traditional” independent energy systems, at both the operational and the planning stage. This paper presents a development of the existing MESsi modelling platform, consisting in the implementation of a model estimating the impacts on air quality and human health. MESsi is a novel distributed infrastructure for modelling and co-simulating Multi-Energy-Systems. It exploits modern software design patterns (i.e. microservices) to guarantee scalability, extendibility and easy maintenance of the system. Thus, MESsi is flexible in modelling and co-simulating different energy flows in a single solution made of different interoperable modules that can be deployed in a plug-and-play fashion. The module to be implemented in MESsi infrastructure is the DIATI integrated dispersion and externalities model (DIDEM). The DIDEM model is based on the impact pathway approach, linking the simulation of pollutants dispersion to the concentration-exposure-response functions provided by latest WHO recommendations. An overview of the potential integration steps in the modelling infrastructure is described in this paper. A discussion on possible application scenarios that have different spatio-temporal resolutions is also reported. The integration of DIDEM model in MESsi platform allows the inter-connection of a detailed impact assessment to a high-level energy system simulation. © 2018 WIT Press.","Air pollution; Health effects; Impact pathway approach; Modelling; Multi-energy systems","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057173917"

Despite accelerating microservice diversity, there is a strong requirement to limit diversity in underlying server hardware to maintain hardware resource fungibility, preserve procurement economies of scale, and curb qualification/test overheads. As such, there is an urgent need for strategies that enable limited server CPU architectures (a.k.a ""SKUs"") to provide performance and energy efficiency over diverse microservices. To this end, we first undertake a comprehensive characterization of the top seven microservices that run on the compute-optimized data center fleet at Facebook. Our characterization reveals profound diversity in OS and I/O interaction, cache misses, memory bandwidth utilization, instruction mix, and CPU stall behavior. Whereas customizing a CPU SKU for each microservice might be beneficial, it is prohibitive. Instead, we argue for ""soft SKUs"", wherein we exploit coarse-grain (e.g., boot time) configuration knobs to tune the platform for a particular microservice. We develop a tool, μSKU, that automates search over a soft-SKU design space using A/B testing in production and demonstrate how it can obtain statistically significant gains (up to 7.2% and 4.5% performance improvement over stock and production servers, respectively) with no additional hardware requirements. © 2019 ACM.","Microservice; Resource fungibility; Soft SKU","Computer architecture; Economics; Energy efficiency; Green computing; Economies of scale; Hardware resources; Memory bandwidths; Microservice; Product portfolios; Resource fungibility; Server architecture; Soft SKU; Computer hardware","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069454735"

A common area of application is the processing of continuous data streams from sensors, for example, IoT devices or performance monitoring tools. In addition to analyzing pure sensor data, analyses of data for groups of sensors often need to be performed as well. Therefore, data streams of the individual sensors have to be continuously aggregated to a data stream for a group. Motivated by a real-world application scenario, we propose that such a stream aggregation approach has to allow for aggregating sensors in hierarchical groups, support multiple such hierarchies in parallel, provide reconfiguration at runtime, and preserve the scalability and reliability qualities induced by applying stream processing techniques. We propose a stream processing architecture fulfilling these requirements, which can be integrated into existing big data architectures. We present a pilot implementation of such an extended architecture and show how it is used in industry. Furthermore, in experimental evaluations we show that our solution scales linearly with the amount of sensors and provides adequate reliability in the case of faults. © 2019 IEEE.","","Big data; Computer architecture; Real time systems; Application scenario; Data architectures; Experimental evaluation; Hierarchical groups; Multi dimensional; Performance monitoring; Pilot implementation; Stream processing; Data streams","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081400615"

To guarantee system performance, cloud computing environment is required to have the ability to handle overloads. The existing approaches, like Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling and VM consolidation, are effective in handling partial overloads, however, they cannot function when the whole data center is overloaded. Brownout has been proved to be a promising approach to relieve the overloads through deactivating application non-mandatory components or microservices temporarily. Moreover, brownout has been applied to reduce data center energy consumption. It shows that there are trade-offs between energy saving and discount offered to users (revenue loss) when one or more services are not provided temporarily. In this paper, we propose a brownout-based approximate Markov Decision Process approach to improve the aforementioned trade-offs. The results based on real trace demonstrate that our approach saves 20% energy consumption than VM consolidation approach.

Cloud computing is an emerging paradigm in which users, depending on their specific requirements, access to a shared pool of computing resources dynamically allocated. Cloud computing represents, with respect to Grid computing, the evolutionary step towards the implementation of a ubiquitous computing service. Such paradigm leverages on the infrastructural capabilities (compute, storage, and network) of modern data centers to provide an adequate level of computational power able to satisfy users' requests. However, trying to continuously increase such capabilities comes at the cost of an increased energy consumption. Energy efficiency is, therefore, one of the major challenges that cloud providers must address. The OPERA project aims at bringing innovative solutions to increase the energy efficiency of cloud infrastructures, by leveraging on modular, high-density, heterogeneous and low power computing systems, which are able to cover the whole computing continuum. To this end, the project will design a high-density server solution in which low power processors and FPGA devices will be used to accelerate cloud workloads. High-speed optical interconnections will be used to connect the proposed server with high-performance nodes, such as OpenPOWER-based machines. Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) represents a natural extension of cloud infrastructures since they can collect and process data locally, more specifically where they were generated. OPERA aims at researching energy efficiency of such cloud end-nodes by designing an ultra-low power computing system with reconfigurable radio frequency capabilities. The effectiveness of the whole platform will be demonstrated with key scenarios, specifically a road traffic monitoring application, the deployment of a virtual desktop infrastructure, and the deployment of a small data center on a truck. © 2016 IEEE.","Cloud infrastructure; energy efficiency; FPGA; heterogeneity","Cloud computing; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Grid computing; Integrated circuit design; Systems analysis; Ubiquitous computing; Cloud infrastructures; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); heterogeneity; Information and Communication Technologies; Innovative solutions; Low power processors; Reconfigurable radios; Road traffic monitoring; Distributed computer systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84998953473"

To address these issues new radio technologies and network architectures need to be designed to cater to several future devices having connectivity demands. For radio communications, the frequency spectrum allocation will have to be adapted for efficient spectrum utilization considering new bandwidth and application requirements. Novel research directions based on the use of opportunistic radio resource utilization such as those based on cognitive radio (CR) technology will have to be pursued for efficiency as well as reliability. Cognitive Radio is a promising enabler communication technology for IoT. Its opportunistic communication paradigm is suited to communicating objects having event driven nature, that generate bursty traffic. Cognitive Radio can help overcome the problems of collision and excessive contention in the wireless access network that will arise due to the deployment of several objects connected to infrastructure through radio links. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed before cognitive radio technology can be used for Internet of things. This paper surveys novel approaches and discusses research challenges related to the use of cognitive radio technology for Internet of things. In addition, the paper presents a general background on cognitive radio and Internet of Things with some potential applications.

We review CR solutions that address generic problems of IoT including emerging challenges of autonomicity, scalability, energy efficiency, heterogeneity in terms of user equipment capabilities, complexity and environments, etc. The solutions are supported by our taxonomy of different CR approaches that are classified into two categories, flexible and efficient networking, and tackling heterogeneity.
