10.1002/dac.5296,2516,Chaudhary R.; Aujla G.S.; Kumar N.; Chouhan P.K.,A comprehensive survey on software-defined networking for smart communities,,,,,,,,,,,,"The need to provide services closer to the end-user proximity leads to the exchange of a large volume of data generated from the smart devices deployed at different geo-distributed sites. The massive amount of data generated from the smart devices need to be transmitted, analyzed, and processed. This requires seamless data exchanges among geo-separated nodes, which results in a considerable burden on the underlying network infrastructure and can degrade the performance of any implemented solution. Therefore, a dynamic, agile, and programmable network management paradigm is required. To handle the challenges mentioned above, software-defined networking (SDN) gained much attention from academia, researchers, and industrial sectors. Shifting the computational load from forwarding devices to a logically centralized controller is a dream of every network operator who wants to have complete control and global visibility of the network. Also, the concept of network functions virtualization (NFV) in SDN controller is required to increase resource utilization efficiency. Thus, in this paper, a comprehensive survey on SDN for various smart applications is presented. This survey covers the infrastructural details of SDN hardware and OpenFlow switches, controllers, simulation tools, programming languages, open issues, and challenges in SDN implementation with advanced technologies such as 5G and microservices. In addition, the challenges on the control plane and data plane are highlighted in detail, such as fault tolerance, routing, scheduling of flows, and energy consumption on OpenFlow switches. Finally, various open issues and challenges future scope of SDN are discussed and analyzed in the proposal. © 2022 The Authors.

10.1002/spe.3217,2577,Wu J.; Zhang J.; Zhang Y.; Wen Y.,Constraint-aware and multi-objective optimization for micro-service composition in mobile edge computing,,,,,,,,,,,,"As a new paradigm of distributed computing, mobile edge computing (MEC) has gained increasing attention due to its ability to expand the capabilities of centralized cloud computing. In MEC environments, a software application typically consists of multiple micro-services, which can be composed together in a flexible manner to achieve various user requests. However, the composition of micro-services in MEC is still a challenging research issue arising from three aspects. Firstly, composite micro-services constructed by ignoring the processing capabilities of different micro-services may cause waste of edge resources. Secondly, edge servers' limitations in terms of computational power can easily cause service occupancy between composite micro-services, severely affecting the user experience. Thirdly, in dynamic and unstable mobile environments, different edge users have different sensitivities to request latency, which increases the complexity of micro-service composition. In order to improve edge resource utilization and user experience on micro-service invocations, in this paper, we comprehensively consider the above three factors, and we first model the micro-services composition problem in MEC as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem. Then, a micro-service composition optimization method M3C combining graph search and branch-and-bound strategy is proposed to find a composition solution set with low energy consumption and high success rate for multiple edge users. Finally, we perform a series of experiments on two widely used datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms the four competing baseline approaches, and that it is sufficiently efficient for practical deployment. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,,micro-service composition; micro-services; mobile edge computing; multi-objective optimization,,,,,,,,"Wu, Jintao (57188570943); Zhang, Jingyi (57215070911); Zhang, Yiwen (38863602600); Wen, Yiping (24451504400)",57188570943; 57215070911; 38863602600; 24451504400,2024,Software - Practice and Experience,,1596,1620,24,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159077377&doi=10.1002%2fspe.3217&partnerID=40&md5=e55bd825337409e2597a6046f99a32d2,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85159077377,Application programs; Branch and bound method; Constrained optimization; Energy utilization; Mobile edge computing; Quality of service; Centralised; Cloud-computing; Computing environments; Edge resources; Micro services; Micro-service composition; Multi-objectives optimization; Services composition; Users' experiences; Multiobjective optimization,0,IC4,63

The proliferation of social media and domotics urges a new kind of ubiquity where different kinds of features are deployed everywhere atop of the everyday life small devices and even embedded in our surroundings. While we measure the opportunities offered by such advancements in improving people lifestyles and obtaining immediate and useful services, it is necessary to consider the real impact on our privacy. Recently, a newly adopted European standard, the General Data Protection Regulation aims at codifying the rules of personal data use. We strongly believe in the necessity for a Smart City of adopting such privacy regulation while benefiting at the same time from new services, in a generic and easy way. In that sense, we build an approach that is at the frontier of the cryptoscience domain for a better privacy and the Micro Service-Oriented Architectures for an increased use by tiers. Indeed, our service is accessible in a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) manner and uses encryption to ensure data privacy. The particularity of our system lies in the fact that the server performs a classification algorithm without any information about the sensitive data and without the capability to decrypt it. The underlying cryptographic technology used is homomorphic encryption, allowing to perform calculations directly on encrypted data. Our service is generic by design and could be applied over several metrics. We adopt an energy efficiency use case and propose a service for buildings energy diagnosis and classification towards renovations and/or reductions of the electric consumption. We showcase our prototype of crypto-classification service by involving different actors of a Smart City community. Finally, we assess our proposal thanks to a set of real data collected from an Irish residential district.

Several research projects are underway to migrate Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) to the public cloud. Some functions of ICSs require real-time processing that is difficult to migrate to the public cloud because network latency of the internet is unpredictable. Fog computing is a new computing paradigm that could address this latency issue. In particular, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) is a fog computing environment integrated with the 5G network, and therefore the real-time processing requirement of ICSs could be satisfied by using MEC. In this paper, we propose a microservice-based ICS architecture using the cloud and fog computing. In the architecture, each function of an ICS is implemented as a microservice and its execution locations are determined by an algorithm minimizing the total usage fee for cloud and fog computing while satisfying the real-time processing requirement. The proposed architecture and placement algorithm are evaluated by simulation under the scenario of a virtual power plant that manages distributed energy resources. The simulation result shows the proposed placement algorithm suppresses VM usage fee while satisfying the requirement of a real-time control function.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5G; Cloud; Fog; Industrial Control System; MEC,0,IC4,49

When these are applied to a real-world scenario we notice the importance of having a system with a satisfactory speed that can fit in the limited resources of most IoMT devices. However, most solutions for distributed MEP are dependent on a Cloud architecture, which makes these applications migration to the Edge more challenging. As a response to this, we present a microservice architecture for DNN-based distributed MEP over heterogeneous Cloud-Edge environments. We describe our solution that allows for an easier deployment both on the Edge and on the Cloud. We show that choosing the proper tools for an Edge-Friendly solution can lead to 100 times less resource utilisation.

Intending to resolve it, this chapter reports on an unique technique that improves an innovative agent-based simulation model, which considers varied specifications such as the size, kind as well as behavior of the different categories of passengers onboard, the energy consuming centers as well as devices of a ship, spatial data concerning the layout of a ship’s decks, and also alternate ship procedures. Based on the suggested approach, results acquired from multiple simulation runs are then used up by appropriate Machine Learning algorithms to extract purposeful patterns in between the structure of passengers as well as the corresponding energy needs in a ship. By doing this, our approach is able to predict different energy consumption situations as well as activate significant insights concerning the total power management in a ship. On the whole, the proposed approach may handle the hidden unpredictability by blending the process-centric character of a simulation model and the data-centric character of Machine Learning algorithms.

Various algorithms have been proposed in order to reduce the total number of required servers and network devices. The practice developed in response to the problem of server sprawl, a situation in which multiple, under-utilized servers (and/or network devices) take up more space and consume more resources than can be justified by their workload; with the effect to power off unused equipment. Generally, consolidation mechanisms consider different parameters related to the services neglecting the specific function of the Virtual Machines (VMs) in the application framework (e.g., core component, backup replica, member of a set of workers for load balancing). In this work, we developed a new consolidation algorithm that takes into account the particular function of each VM with the aim to apply power saving mechanisms without compromising the desired service level. The results of the simulations show that it is possible to obtain significant values of energy saving. In particular, we show, with different heuristics, the optimal trade-off between service level and power efficiency achieved by the proposed model. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,,,Cloud applications; Consolidation; Energy-aware; Green; Heuristics; Optimization; Virtual machines,,,,,,,,"Carrega, Alessandro (36633941300); Repetto, Matteo (57194639871)",36633941300; 57194639871,2017,Communications in Computer and Information Science,,230,250,20,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030153378&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-67639-5_17&partnerID=40&md5=07c6e2decd8494327c6f9a69973444a1,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030153378,Consolidation; Digital communication systems; Economic and social effects; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Network security; Optimization; Power management; Virtual machine; Application frameworks; Cloud applications; Consolidation mechanisms; Efficient strategy; Energy aware; Green; Heuristics; Power saving mechanism; Green computing,0,IC3,69

To guarantee system performance, cloud computing environment is required to have the ability to handle overloads. The existing approaches, like Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling and VM consolidation, are effective in handling partial overloads, however, they cannot function when the whole data center is overloaded. Brownout has been proved to be a promising approach to relieve the overloads through deactivating application non-mandatory components or microservices temporarily. Moreover, brownout has been applied to reduce data center energy consumption. It shows that there are trade-offs between energy saving and discount offered to users (revenue loss) when one or more services are not provided temporarily.

10.1007/s00607-019-00733-4,3131,Lakhan A.; Li X.,Transient fault aware application partitioning computational offloading algorithm in microservices based mobile cloudlet networks,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mobile Cloudlet Computing paradigm (MCC) allows execution of resource-intensive mobile applications using computation cloud resources by exploiting computational offloading method for resource-constrained mobile devices. Whereas, computational offloading needs the mobile application to be partitioned during the execution in the MCC so that total execution cost is minimized. In the MCC, at the run-time network contexts (i.e., network bandwidth, signal strength, latency, etc.) are intermittently changed, and transient failures (due to temporary network connection failure, services busy, database disk out of storage) often occur for a short period of time. Therefore, transient failure aware partitioning of the mobile application at run-time is a challenging task. Since, existing MCC offers computational monolithic services by exploiting heavyweight virtual machines, which incurs with long VM startup time and high overhead, and these cannot meet the requirements of fine-grained microservices applications (e.g., E-healthcare, E-business, 3D-Game, and Augmented Reality). To cope up with prior issues, we propose microservices based mobile cloud platform by exploiting containerization which replaces heavyweight virtual machines, and we propose the application partitioning task assignment (APTA) algorithm which determines application partitioning at run-time and adopts the fault aware (FA) policy to execute microservices applications robustly without interruption in the MCC. Simulation results validate that the proposed microservices mobile cloud platform not only shrinks the setup time of run-time platform but also reduce the energy consumption of nodes and improve the application response time by exploiting APTA and FA to the existing VM based MCC and application partitioning strategies. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,,,Application partitioning; Application programming interface (API); APTA; FA; Microservices; Min-cut; Mobile cloudlet computing; Offloadi ng; Representational state transfer (REST),,,,,,,,"Lakhan, Abdullah (57209259574); Li, Xiaoping (55900922400)",57209259574; 55900922400,2020,Computing,,105,139,34,41,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067040812&doi=10.1007%2fs00607-019-00733-4&partnerID=40&md5=d962d0ae3742a573ac5b2abe6895172e,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067040812,Application programming interfaces (API); Augmented reality; Energy utilization; Green computing; Interface states; mHealth; Mobile computing; Network security; Simulation platform; Virtual machine; Application partitioning; APTA; Microservices; Min-cut; Mobile cloudlet computing; Offloadi ng; Representational state transfer; Mobile cloud computing,0,IC3,66

When it comes to working with them, we find a series of problems that are not easy to solve. On the one hand, the simple fact of communicating with those devices can be problematic since they can use different types of technologies regarding that communication. On the other hand, these types of devices usually aim to perform their function using the lowest possible energy, meaning they have certain constraints in terms of performance. Trying to work with these devices in high-availability environments becomes difficult because of those restraints. This paper introduces digital dice, a virtual representation of IoT devices and cyber-physical systems based on microservices that uses the standard established by the W3C, the Web of Things, as the underlying framework to declare its possible interactions. The article puts forward the different strategies that Digital Dice uses to mitigate the problems raised.

These disruptions can be caused by a variety of factors, such as hardware failures, software glitches, cyber attacks, or even natural disasters. Modern computational environments need applications that can recover quickly from major disruptions while also being environmentally sustainable. Balancing system resilience with energy efficiency is challenging, as efforts to improve one can harm the other. This paper presents a method to enhance disaster survivability in microservice architectures, particularly those using Kubernetes in cloud-based environments, focusing on optimizing electrical energy use. Aiming to save energy, our work adopt the consolidation strategy that means grouping multiple microservices on a single host. Our aproach uses a widely adopted analytical model, the Generalized Stochastic Petri Net (GSPN). GSPN are a powerful modeling technique that is widely used in various fields, including engineering, computer science, and operations research. One of the primary advantages of GSPN is its ability to model complex systems with a high degree of accuracy. Additionally, GSPN allows for the modeling of both logical and stochastic behavior, making it ideal for systems that involve a combination of both. Our GSPN models compute a number of metrics such as: recovery time, system availability, reliability, Mean Time to Failure, and the configuration of cloud-based microservices. We compared our approach against others focusing on survivability or efficiency. Our approach aligns with Recovery Time Objectives during sudden disasters and offers the fastest recovery, requiring 9% less warning time to fully recover in cases of disaster with alert when compared to strategies with similar electrical consumption. It also saves about 27% energy compared to low consolidation strategies and 5% against high consolidation under static conditions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2024.",,,,68M14; 68M15; 68U01; Availability; Microservices; Petri nets; Reliability; Survivabiliry,,,,,,,,"Fé, Iure (57194271358); Nguyen, Tuan Anh (56433780500); Mauro, Mario Di (54396864500); Postiglione, Fabio (35238137800); Ramos, Alex (59175549600); Soares, André (57217263565); Choi, Eunmi (8969714200); Min, Dugki (7201670327); Lee, Jae Woo (57203409283); Silva, Francisco Airton (55817259800)",57194271358; 56433780500; 54396864500; 35238137800; 59175549600; 57217263565; 8969714200; 7201670327; 57203409283; 55817259800,2024,Computing,,2737,2783,46,2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196171876&doi=10.1007%2fs00607-024-01305-x&partnerID=40&md5=b5b1962d30b5b522305b7d006316c20a,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85196171876,Balancing; Energy efficiency; Network security; Petri nets; Power management; Recovery; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; 68m14; 68m15; 68u01; Cloud-based; Energy aware; Generalized Stochastic Petri nets; Microservice; Survivabiliry; System resiliences; Unexpected events; Disasters,0,IC4,99

However, ensuring the correctness of scaling decisions and their impact on energy consumption is a challenging problem that has not been sufficiently addressed in previous research. Thus, in this paper, we present an innovative approach for analyzing host energy consumption and energy violations influenced by microservice autoscaling policies using probabilistic model checking (PMC). We propose four variations of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) models that incorporate various scaling constraints inspired by Kubernetes-based Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, and we encode these models using two different approaches, namely, bounded-by-action (BBA) and bounded-by-state (BBS). We use PMC to verify the scaling policies in terms of host energy consumption and energy violations, and we conduct sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of our models in generating energy-efficient scaling policies. Our results show that the latency and energy-based MDP model offers the most suitable policies for ensuring energy efficiency in microservice systems. Additionally, the number of pods and the scale-out action significantly affect energy consumption and violations. Sensitivity analysis also reveals that incorporating latency into scaling decisions is key to energy efficiency, while variations in the maximum pod threshold significantly influence energy consumption and violation. Our approach provides a formal method for ensuring the correctness of microservice autoscaling decisions in cloud environments at design time and can help reduce energy consumption and violations while ensuring service-level objectives are met. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",,,,Energy-driven microservice autoscaling; Formal verification; Kubernetes; Markov decision process; Microservices; Probabilistic model checking,,,,,,,,"Agos Jawaddi, Siti Nuraishah (58283711400); Ismail, Azlan (55377382600); Sulaiman, Mohd Suffian (57212956093); Cardellini, Valeria (6603463586)",58283711400; 55377382600; 57212956093; 6603463586,2025,Journal of Grid Computing,3,,,,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85213696655&doi=10.1007%2fs10723-024-09789-9&partnerID=40&md5=2351a5b1f5d24e45730f45c2899e134e,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213696655,Cloud computing; Energy efficiency; Formal verification; Health risks; Model checking; Program debugging; Sensitivity analysis; Autoscaling; Energy-consumption; Energy-driven; Energy-driven microservice autoscaling; Kubernetes; Markov Decision Processes; Microservice; Probabilistic model checking; Probabilistic model-checking; Scalings; Markov processes,0,IC4,22

Despite this progress, over two billion individuals in rural and low-income regions face a complete absence of Internet access. This lack of connectivity hinders the implementation of vital services like remote healthcare, emergency assistance, distance learning, and personal communications. To bridge this gap and bring essential services to rural populations, this paper leverages Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposal introduces a UAV-based network architecture and an energy-efficient algorithm to deploy Internet of Things (IoT) applications. These applications are broken down into microservices, strategically distributed among a subset of UAVs. This approach addresses the limitations associated with running an entire IoT application on a single UAV, which could lead to suboptimal outcomes due to battery and computational constraints. Simulation results conducted in a realistic scenario underscore the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

To develop sustainability-aware software, green metrics have been implemented to estimate the energy consumed by the execution of an application. However, they have a rebound energy consumption effect because they require an application to be executed to estimate the energy consumed after each change. To address this problem, it is necessary to construct energy estimation models that do not require the execution of applications. This work addresses this problem by constructing a green model based on size, complexity and duplicated lines to estimate the energy consumed by model-view-controller applications without their execution. This article defines a model constructed based on 52 applications. The results were accurate in twelve applications, which showed that the joule estimation was very close to reality, avoiding the energy consumed by the execution of applications. © 2023, The Author(s).",,,,Architectural patterns; Energy consumption estimation; Green software; Model-view controller (MVC); Software architectures,,,,,,,,"Guamán, Daniel (57188566526); Pérez, Jennifer (37043795900); Valdiviezo-Diaz, Priscila (36186316400)",57188566526; 37043795900; 36186316400,2023,Journal of Supercomputing,,13766,13793,27,2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151338800&doi=10.1007%2fs11227-023-05202-6&partnerID=40&md5=647088e011dc284be3e69deeef20d643,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85151338800,Application programs; Controllers; Software architecture; Architectural pattern; Energy; Energy consumption estimation; Energy-consumption; Green metrics; Green software; Information and Communication Technologies; Model-view controller; Zero emission; Energy utilization,0,IC4,75

At the same time, digitalization introduces new possibilities to leverage the untapped optimization potential to provide this flexibility. Mathematical optimization methods such as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) are widely used to predict optimal operation plans for industrial systems. MILP models are difficult to adapt, but the viability of the predicted plans relies on accurate underlying models of the actual behavior. New automation paradigms, such as the digital twin (DT), can overcome these current drawbacks. In this work, we present the implementation and experimental evaluation of several micro-services on a standardized five-dimensional DT platform that automate MILP model adaption and operation optimization. These micro-services guarantee that, (1) deviations between the physical entity and its virtual entity models are detected, (2) the models are adapted accordingly, (3) subsequently linearized to suit the MILP approach and (4) used for live operational optimization. These novel services and DT workflows that orchestrate them were experimentally tested with a packed bed thermal energy storage (PBTES) test rig that acts as a physical entity. A waste heat recovery use case in steel production is used as the evaluation scenario. While the model error of a static simulation model would increase to 60% over 7 days of operation, the model error remains well below 25% as a result of successful model adaption. The prediction error of the optimization model remains in a typical magnitude of 10 to 20% during the evaluation period, despite the degradation of the PBTES power. © 2023 The Author(s)",,,,Digital twin (DT); Iron and steel industry; Mixed integer linear programming (MILP); Operation optimization; Thermal energy storage; Waste heat recovery,,,,,,,,"Kasper, Lukas (57217080482); Schwarzmayr, Paul (57219354141); Birkelbach, Felix (57194472014); Javernik, Florian (57188999402); Schwaiger, Michael (58539225300); Hofmann, René (55413515600)",57217080482; 57219354141; 57194472014; 57188999402; 58539225300; 55413515600,2024,Applied Energy,122192,,,,10,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85175337178&doi=10.1016%2fj.apenergy.2023.122192&partnerID=40&md5=5d9e4e1f30fd4b720c35fb722285eab5,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85175337178,Errors; Heat storage; Integer programming; Iron and steel industry; Packed beds; Steelmaking; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Digital twin; Integer Linear Programming; Micro services; Mixed integer linear; Mixed integer linear programming; Mixed integer linear programming model; Operations optimization; Steel production; Thermal energy storage; Waste-heat recovery; alternative energy; energy storage; iron and steel industry; linear programing; optimization; waste management; Thermal energy,0,IC4,119

In particular, by leveraging Network Performance Metrics (NPMs) coming from the Radio Access Network (RAN) and sharing context-related information, AI-driven MSs have demonstrated to be highly effective in optimizing RAN performance. In this context, this work addresses the critical challenge of ensuring efficient data sharing and consistency by proposing a holistic platform that regulates the collection and usage of NPMs. We first introduce two reference platform architectures and detail their implementation using popular, off-the-shelf database solutions. Then, to evaluate and compare such architectures and their implementation, we develop PACE, a highly configurable, scalable, MS-based emulation framework of producers and consumers of NPMs, capable of realistically reproducing a broad range of interaction patterns and load dynamics. Using PACE on our cloud computing testbed, we conduct a thorough characterization of various NPM platform architectures and implementations under a spectrum of realistic edge traffic scenarios, from loosely coupled control loops to latency- and mission- critical use cases. Our results reveal fundamental trade-offs in stability, availability, scalability, resource usage, and energy footprint, demonstrating how PACE effectively enables the identification of suitable platform solutions depending on the reference edge scenario and the required levels of reliability and data consistency. © 2025 The Authors",,,,Data availability; Data consistency; Edge computing; Microservices,,,,,,,,"Calagna, Antonio (58512977800); Ravera, Stefano (59663749400); Chiasserini, Carla Fabiana (7004886008)",58512977800; 59663749400; 7004886008,2025,Computer Networks,111158,,,,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85219496402&doi=10.1016%2fj.comnet.2025.111158&partnerID=40&md5=f64d1e547fad5b1fffd2abc6d9567fa1,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219496402,Cloud platforms; Radio access networks; Computing applications; Data availability; Data consistency; De facto standard; Edge computing; Microservice; Network performance metrics; Performance; Platform architecture; Radio access networks; Cloud computing architecture,0,IC4,71

One way of keeping honey bees healthy is to be able to monitor and control the general conditions in a beehive and also outside of a beehive. Monitoring systems offer an effective way of accessing, visualizing, sharing, and managing data that is gathered from performed agricultural and livestock activities for domain stakeholders. Such systems have recently been implemented based on wireless sensor networks (WSN) and IoT to monitor the activities of honey bees in beehives as well. Scholars have shown considerable interests in proposing IoT- and WSN-based beehive monitoring systems, but much of the research up to now lacks in proposing appropriate architecture for open data driven beehive monitoring systems. Developing a robust monitoring system based on a contemporary software architecture such as microservices can be of great help to be able to control the activities of honey bees and more importantly to be able to keep them healthy in beehives.

The focus is on employing green extraction technologies, such as microwave-assisted methods, to produce valuable compounds like seed oil, pectin, and bioactive substances for use in the cosmetic, nutraceutical, and pharmaceutical industries. The results demonstrate that increasing the scale of production from 200 to 400 tons significantly enhances the financial performance of the operation, reducing the payback period from 6.5 to 4 years and yielding positive Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) values, reaching up to 35.7 %. However, challenges such as the seasonality of raw material availability and the high energy requirements of green technologies are noted. These findings suggest that while the project is economically feasible, managing supply chain variability and optimising energy consumption are critical for long-term sustainability. Additionally, the increasing consumer demand for sustainable and functional products provides a strong market opportunity for these bioproducts, though competition from international players leveraging economies of scale could pose a threat. This study highlights the importance of integrating green technologies in bioeconomy projects and offers insights for policymakers and industry leaders. Policymakers can support these initiatives through incentives and regulations, while businesses in the cosmetic and nutraceutical sectors may find competitive advantages in the quality and sustainability of these bioproducts.

Context-aware data generation and forwarding for edge-based microservices over shared IoT infrastructure,,,,,,,,,,,,"With the explosion of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the advent of the edge computing paradigm, and the rise of intelligent applications for smart infrastructure surveillance, in-network data management is gaining a lot of research attention these days. The challenge lies in accommodating multiple application microservices with varying Quality of Service (QoS) requirements to share the sensing infrastructure for better resource utilization. In this work, we propose a novel data collection framework, CaDGen (Context-aware Data Generation) for such a shared IoT infrastructure that enables integrated data filtration and forwarding towards minimizing the resource consumption footprint for the IoT infrastructure. The proposed filtration mechanism utilizes the contextual information associated with the running application for determining the relevance of the data. Whereas the proposed forwarding policy aims to satisfy the diverse QoS requirements for the running applications by selecting the suitable next-hop forwarder based on the microservices distribution across different edge devices. A thorough performance evaluation of CaDGen through a testbed implementation as well as a simulation study for diverse setups reveals promising results concerning network resource utilization, scalability, energy conservation, and distribution of computation for optimal service provisioning. It is observed that the CaDGen can achieve nearly 35% reduction in the generated data for a moderately dynamic scenario without compromising on the data quality. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",,,,Context-aware; Data collection; Edge computing; Microservice; Sensing,,,,,,,,"Das, Anirban (57214490495); Chakraborty, Sandip (54396851400); Chakraborty, Suchetana (46661882600)",57214490495; 54396851400; 46661882600,2022,Future Generation Computer Systems,,204,218,14,9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129245821&doi=10.1016%2fj.future.2022.03.027&partnerID=40&md5=40757b1c56aa2b1db7cb1e5d8175d878,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85129245821,Automation; Data acquisition; Edge computing; Information management; Network security; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Quality of service; Context-Aware; Data collection; Data generation; Data-forwarding; Edge computing; Microservice; Quality-of-service; Running applications; Service requirements; Smart homes; Internet of things,0,IC4,53

Rural regions, characterized by having low population densities, suffer this lack of provision the most. On top of that, the remoteness and complicated orography of rural localities render traditional network infrastructure close to useless. To ensure that these localities benefit from access to digital services and to the Internet, we envision the use of swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Through computing enabled UAVs, the deployment of IoT applications decomposed into microservices that have an impact in the main socio-economic activities becomes a possibility. However, UAVs consume a lot of battery power, which complicates the feasibility of their use in real-world environments. To overcome this limitation, in this paper the energy optimal deployment and migration of microservices is studied, resulting in an Mix Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem formulation. As a result, an optimal battery drain aware deployer and migrator of microservices in UAV-based networks is proposed.

It decomposes monolithic software into a set of loosely coupled containerized microservices and associates them into multiple microservice chains to serve service requests. The new architecture creates flexibility for service provisioning but also introduces increased energy consumption and low service performance. Efficient resource allocation is critical. Unfortunately, existing solutions are designed at a coarse level for virtual machine (VM)-based clouds and not optimized for such chain-oriented service provisioning. In this paper, we study the resource allocation optimization problem for service request routing and microservice instance placement, so as to jointly reduce both resource usage and chains’ end-to-end response time for saving energy and guaranteeing Quality of Service (QoS). We design detailed workload models for microservices and chains and formulate the optimization problem as a bi-criteria optimization problem. To address it, a three-stage scheme is proposed to search and optimize the trade-off decisions, route service requests into instances and deploy instances to servers in a balanced manner.

Industrial practitioners perceive the importance of applying architectural patterns but they struggle to quantify their impact on system quality requirements. Our research aims to quantify the effect of design patterns on system performance metrics, e.g., service latency and resource utilization, even more so when the patterns operate in real-world environments subject to heterogeneous workloads. We built a cloud infrastructure to host a well-established benchmark system that represents our test bed, complemented by the implementation of three design patterns: Gateway Aggregation, Gateway Offloading, Pipe and Filters. Real performance measurements are collected and compared with model-based predictions that we derived as part of our previous research, thus further consolidating the actual impact of these patterns. Our results demonstrate that, despite the difficulty to parameterize our benchmark system, model-based predictions are in line with real experimentation, since the performance behaviors of patterns, e.g., bottleneck switches, are mostly preserved. In summary, this is the first work that experimentally demonstrates the performance behavior of microservices-based architectural patterns.

As a new representative of virtualization technology, containers have been widely used in software development, operation and maintenance, testing and other aspects, such as microservices and Docker Cloud. In cloud data centers, containers have gradually replaced virtual machines (VMs) as a new carrier for cloud tasks. However, with the increasing number of cloud products, the scale of tasks requested by users in cloud data centers continues to expand. The economic cost of tasks in the process of containerized deployment has become a concern of various cloud service vendors. The container deployment cost usually includes the data exchange cost, the image pull cost and the server energy cost. In order to solve the containerized deployment of application tasks in the container cloud environment with the lowest possible container deployment cost, this paper proposes a new cost calculation model in a container cloud environment, and then presents an improved particles swarm algorithm, namely a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for container deployment (CD-PSO) to provide the best solution for application task loading.

These often facilitate efficient load balancing, low-level system maintenance, server consolidation (for efficient energy and resource utilization) and replication of instances over geographical locations for better fault tolerance to escalate application reliability. However, some recent literature have addressed various challenges (such as complex networking, persistent storage facilities, cross data centers and multicloud supports, security issues, and lack of available, capable container management APIs, etc.) regarding successful container adoption in industries, which might have resulted in a seemingly meager increase in industrial deployments of containerization over the past few years despite bestowing efficient lightweight virtualization. Moreover, a comprehensive overview of containerizations along with their popularity dynamics has still not been found in contemporary literature, which further extends knowledge gap between developers and available technologies. Hence, current study touches upon different technicalities involved in containerization with potential problems and possible solutions along with various important industrial applications to manifest its existing supports and technical hardships. Finally, we have conducted a comprehensive experimental study to compare the performance of VMs, containers and unikernels in terms of CPU utilization, memory footprints, network bandwidth, execution time and technological maturity using standard benchmarks and observed containers to deliver satisfactory performance in almost all aspects, however, are still not free from issues regarding isolation & security, performance stability, lack of available efficient tools for crossplatform support and persistent storage. Unikernels deliver good performance with VM-like isolation but still need to achieve desired technical maturity (in terms of microprocessor stability, process containment, persistent storage, etc.).

However, the on-demand use of energy is considered a big challenge to achieve the optimal cost for households. This paper proposes a blockchain-based predictive energy trading platform to provide real-time support, day-ahead controlling, and generation scheduling of distributed energy resources. The proposed blockchain-based platform consists of two modules; blockchain-based energy trading and smart contract enabled predictive analytics modules. The blockchain module allows peers with real-time energy consumption monitoring, easy energy trading control, reward model, and unchangeable energy trading transaction logs. The smart contract enabled predictive analytics module aims to build a prediction model based on historical energy consumption data to predict short-term energy consumption. This paper uses real energy consumption data acquired from the Jeju province energy department, the Republic of Korea. This study aims to achieve optimal power flow and energy crowdsourcing, supporting energy trading among the consumer and prosumer. Energy trading is based on day-ahead, real-time control, and scheduling of distributed energy resources to meet the smart grid's load demand. Moreover, we use data mining techniques to perform time-series analysis to extract and analyze underlying patterns from the historical energy consumption data. The time-series analysis supports energy management to devise better future decisions to plan and manage energy resources effectively. To evaluate the proposed predictive model's performance, we have used several statistical measures, such as mean square error and root mean square error on various machine learning models, namely recurrent neural networks and alike. Moreover, we also evaluate the blockchain platform's effectiveness through hyperledger calliper in terms of latency, throughput, and resource utilization.

The placement of application components (e.g., in the form of containerized microservices) on ECs has an important effect on the energy consumption of ECs, impacting both energy costs and carbon emissions. Due to the geographic distribution of ECs, there is a variety of resources, energy prices and carbon emission rates to consider, which makes optimizing the placement of applications for cost and carbon efficiency even more challenging than in centralized clouds. This paper presents a Dynamic Energy cost and Carbon emission-efficient Application placement method (DECA) for ECs. DECA addresses both the initial placement of applications on ECs and the re-optimization of the placement using migrations. DECA considers geographically varying energy prices and carbon emission rates as well as optimizing the usage of both network and computing resources at the same time.

As the ICT sector transitions from traditional cloud computing to edge cloud to enhance proximity, it has adopted hypervisor-based virtualization. The emergence of beyond 5G systems, characterized by the need for autonomous orchestration, decentralized processing, ultra-low latency, and high throughput, necessitates a shift towards a distributed cloud system with autonomous functionalities. This infrastructure enables proactive control and management of network functions, allowing the delivery of services and microservices through a preconfigured setup at the edge. In regions prone to geographical instability, where network integrity can be compromised by natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis, establishing a robust, self-managing network is crucial. Such a network should be capable of independently providing services using local resources, functioning autonomously without external reliance, and effectively managing itself. This paper introduces NerveNet-VNF, a concept focusing on container-based virtualization of network functions. This system is coupled with SDN technology and integrated with a Dynamic Load Balancing (D-LB) system within a distributed cloud architecture. This integrated solution enables the hosting, management, and provisioning of local microservice requirements. Additionally, it introduces a new concept for splitting network functionality based on containers compared to the traditional abstract splitting system. Evaluation of this system demonstrates improvements in latency and throughput. Notably, there is a 20% reduction in NerveNet-VNF request execution time compared to the pre-existing NerveNet network.

We compare this algorithm against three baseline algorithms through simulations on a real-world dataset, evaluating performance metrics such as execution time, network usage, average migration delay, and energy consumption. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, with an 8% reduction in execution time, translating to faster response times for users. Additionally, it achieves a 4% decrease in network usage and a 2% decrease in energy consumption compared to the best-performing baseline. This research contributes by reproducing the Edge-Cloud environment, applying the novel Bi-Generic Advantage Actor-Critic technique, and demonstrating significant improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline algorithms in microservice placement and resource management within Edge-Cloud environments.",,"Telkom, South Africa; ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10680533,Edge computing;microservices;network optimization;online placement;scheduling algorithms;reinforcement learning,,1,,32,CCBYNCND,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Microservice architectures;Heuristic algorithms;Reliability;Optimization methods;Resource management;Containers;Edge computing;Scheduling;User centered design;Reinforcement learning,0,IC4,26

One of the most important advantages of the new microservice-based SaaS deployment is that the increase in energy consumption incurred by the deployment of a new microservice-based SaaS can be considered. With the aim of reducing the increase in energy consumption, this paper proposes a new method, namely Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization (HPSO), to solve the microservice-based SaaS deployment problem. The HPSO incorporates adaptive inertia weight, cognitive, and social parameters to balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation during the optimization process. Furthermore, the HPSO incorporates a local optimizer to improve the best global solution within the swarm, with a specific emphasis on improving energy efficiency. To evaluate the performance of the HPSO, we have implemented it and compared it with a GA method by experiment.

Based on static configurations, traditional security approaches have proven ineffective in the face of the dynamic nature of emerging threats, as they cannot adapt in real time to changes in the environment or new attack vectors. This work proposes an adaptive security framework for Internet of Things (IoT) systems capable of autonomously detecting, mitigating, and adapting to various threats, improving precision and response times, and optimizing energy consumption. The framework was implemented in a distributed Internet of Things environment, using adaptive architectures based on the Robot Operating System (ROS) and microservices orchestration with Kubernetes. The results showed a significant improvement in response time, with a reduction of 44%, reaching an average of 250 milliseconds, compared to 450 milliseconds for static approaches. Furthermore, a 92% precision in threat detection was achieved, reducing false positives to 4% and false negatives to 6%. Power consumption was controlled, reaching a maximum of 160 milliamp-hours after facing multiple threats, confirming the system’s efficiency in resource-limited environments.

However, the latter devices, usually referred to as far edge devices, have stringent resource constraints and host non-Linux-based embedded real-time operating systems. Therefore, orchestrating such devices executing portions of ML applications represents a major challenge with current tools and frameworks. This paper formally introduces the Tiny-MLOps framework as the specialization of standard ML orchestration practices, including far edge devices in the loop. To this aim, we will tailor each phase of the classical ML orchestration loop to the reduced resources available onboard typical IoT devices. We will rely on the proposed framework to deliver adaptation and evolving capabilities to resource-constrained IoT sensors mounted on an industrial rotary machine to detect anomalies. As a feasibility study, We will show how to programmatically re-deploy ML-based anomaly detection models to far edge devices. Our preliminary experiments measuring the system performance in terms of deployment, loading, and inference latency of the ML models will corroborate the usefulness of our proposal.",978-1-6654-3706-6,Provincia Autonoma di Trento;,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9787703,,,13,,20,IEEE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Adaptation models;Costs;Image edge detection;System performance;Transforms;Real-time systems;Sensors,0,EC3,2531

However, modern cloud-edge infrastructures are characterized by large numbers of disparate providers, constrained resource devices, platform heterogeneity, infrastructural dynamicity, and the need to orchestrate geographically distributed nodes and devices over public networks. This presents significant management complexity that must be addressed if serverless technologies are to be used in production systems. This position paper introduces COGNIT, a major new European initiative aiming to integrate AI technology into cloud-edge management systems to create a Cognitive Cloud reference framework and associated tools for serverless computing at the edge. COGNIT aims to: 1) support an innovative new serverless paradigm for edge application management and enhanced digital sovereignty for users and developers; 2) enable on-demand deployment of large-scale, highly distributed and self-adaptive serverless environments using existing cloud resources; 3) optimize data placement according to changes in energy efficiency heuristics and application demands and behavior; 4) enable secure and trusted execution of serverless runtimes.

Nonetheless, they often suffer from high overhead of communications over network and/or PCIe links. To tackle the limitations of the current solutions, this paper proposes RAMBDA, a holistic network and architecture co-design solution that leverages current RDMA and emerging cache-coherent off-chip interconnect technologies. Specifically, RAMBDA consists of four hardware and software components: (1) unified abstraction of inter- and intra-machine communications synergistically managed by one-sided RDMA write and cache-coherent memory write; (2) efficient notification of requests to accelerators assisted by cache coherence; (3) cache-coherent accelerator architecture directly interacting with NIC; and (4) adaptive device-to-host data transfer for modern server memory systems comprising both DRAM and NVM exploiting state-of-the-art features in CPUs and PCIe. We prototype RAMBDA with a commercial system and evaluate three popular datacenter applications: (1) in-memory key-value store, (2) chain replication-based distributed transaction system, and (3) deep learning recommendation model inference. The evaluation shows that RAMBDA provides 30.1~69.1% lower latency, 0.2~2.5× throughput, and ~ 3× higher energy efficiency than the current state-of-the-art solutions, including Smart NIC.

However, the actual power draw of a server running a specific application under load is not available without specialized measurement equipment or power consumption models. Yet, granularity is often only down to machine level and not application level. In this paper, we propose a monitoring and modeling approach to estimate power consumption on an application function level. The model uses performance counters that are allocated to specific functions to assess their impact on the total power consumption. Hence our model applies to a large variety of servers and for micro-service and serverless workloads. Our model uses an additional correction to minimize falsely allocated performance counters and increase accuracy.

While there exist design patterns for microservices that are theoretically beneficial for ensuring performance (and anti-patterns that should be avoided), they do not always lead to the expected impact. Some designs are solutions for achieving quality properties other than performance, and while they might be categorized as anti-patterns in theory, their influence on system performance can be minimal, depending on the context. Architects find it hard to reason about these trade-offs and the impact that design decisions will have on performance before implementing them. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose an approach that enables rapid evaluation of high-level architectural models by combining both static and dynamic analysis. The static analysis identifies the design anti-patterns that are known to hinder system performance and guides the architect in reasoning about these design decisions. The approach then generates source code for the system under study based on the architectural design model for a subsequent dynamic analysis to assess whether the statically detected anti-patterns do indeed have a negative effect on the performance of the analyzed system.",978-1-6654-6459-8,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10092669,microservices;design decisions;anti-patterns;performance testing,,1,,17,IEEE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Analytical models;Software architecture;System performance;Source coding;Microservice architectures;Static analysis;Cognition,0,EC3 but probably useful,95

The increasing adoption of microservice architectures, while offering scalability and flexibility, poses new challenges in the effective management of systems’ energy consumption.This study analyzes experimentally the effectiveness, with respect to energy consumption, of algorithms for Anomaly Detection (AD) and Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for (containerized) microservices systems. The study analyzes five AD and three RCA algorithms. Metrics to assess the effectiveness of AD algorithms are Precision, Recall, and F-Score. For RCA algorithms, the chose metric is Precision at level k. Two subjects of different complexity are used: Sock Shop and UNI-Cloud. Experiments use a cross-over paired comparison design, involving multiple randomized runs for robust measures.The experiments show that AD algorithms exhibit a relatively moderate performance. The mean adjusted Precision for Sock Shop is 61.5%, while it is 75% for the best-performing algorithms (BIRCH, KNN, and SVM) on UNI-Cloud. The Recall and F-Score for UNI-Cloud, for the same algorithms, are 75%, while for Sock Shop KNN yields the best outcome at roughly 45%.

As traffic congestion is a major problem in the majority of cities around the world, keeping smart traffic flow on the roads is essential as it helps both citizens and security agencies. The traffic signals continuously turn green or red, and the signals for traffic need to change based on how many vehicles are present in the area. The green lights should be on longer in situations where there is a lot of traffic going in one way, and the red lights should stay on longer in situations where there is less traffic. The first should be given to emergency vehicles like ambulances and fire extinguishing engines. Consequently, the idea suggested here is a system in which the length of the green and red light timings is controlled by the volume of traffic at that particular time. If an emergency vehicle is in a lane, that lane is cleared before any other. The implementation of IoT technology is key to our solution. It allows for wireless connectivity between devices that can be monitored and controlled from anywhere, at any time. We use this technology to connect IR sensors that measure the density of vehicles on the road. Additionally, a camera takes pictures of emergency vehicles which are processed in the server by using image processing techniques where the image is processed and calibrated so that signal is sent to the server. The information about emergency vehicles and the density of traffic on each road is then sent to a microcontroller, specifically the ESP32.

PISCO is able to deploy and schedule (move, duplicate, start/stop) microservices and their dependencies on various devices with software and hardware heterogeneity (CPU, bandwidth, RAM, Battery, etc.), taking into account various scheduling heuristics algorithms: centralized vs non-centralized. To do this, PISCO allows deploying custom network topologies based on client-server schemes or p2p distributions, where devices can (dis)appear, turn on/off obeying random circumstances or user strategies.Finally, the simulator performs relevant operations such as QoS definition, resource monitoring, calculation of energy saved and consumption tracking (at device and network level).

A UAV-based network infrastructure is different from traditional cellular networks relying on Base Stations. By mounting small cells on top of UAVs, coverage can be enhanced in regions where network operators avoid to invest due to the low Return on Investment. In case there is a requirement for an enhanced throughput in a rural area (e.g., users requesting IoT applications with strict QoS requriements), a potential solution is to place several UAV s over the same area, thus maximizing the offered throughput. However, this situation would lead to an increase in the energy consumption. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes an optimal solution to the problem of jointly maximizing the offered throughput in rural scenarios where users request microservice-based IoT applications, while minimizing the energy consumption of the swarm of UAV s.

Many scientists investigate methods to save energy at different application levels (cloud: i.e., architectures, grid: i.e., middlewares and frameworks and hardware management: i.e., operating systems) and many of them agree on the strategy of executing programs, processes or virtual machines only using the time and resources that are strictly necessary. For this, it is necessary to plan strategies for deployment and relocation of processes; but always taking into account hardware repercussions and the knowledge of the architecture and applications behavior. On the other hand, it has already been demonstrated that the use of microservices brings numerous advantages in availability and efficiency; but we do not find many jobs that exploit this technique on the energy level.

Compared to existing Kubernetes frameworks and scheduling procedures, the advantages of KOptim are: (i) it facilitates the configuration of container resources using Service Level Agreement (SLA) classes, and (ii) it optimizes the online scheduling of containers using a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) algorithm. In short, the main contribution of KOptim is to simplify Kubernetes scheduler optimization, as well as other issues related to container configuration and validation. In KOptim, we propose to configure and manage container resources using a new model with three SLA classes related to CPUs, memory, and storage space. Each SLA class has three Quality of Services (QoS): Premium, Advanced, and Best Effort. Using the KOptim SLA classes, users can select a range of values for a service instead of specifying a fixed amount of resources for each container. This is designed to help non-expert users who do not need to know exactly how many resources must be used to configure their containers easily. In the scheduling step, we suggest using a mechanism based on a multi-criteria decision algorithm that allows users to consider several criteria during the online scheduling decision. In summary, KOptim is a generic framework for Kubernetes distributions even K3s and MicroK8s which are adapted to Fog and Edge computing. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of our framework to improve performance in terms of runtime and energy consumption.",979-8-3503-6460-6,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10596385,Container technology;Service Level Agreement;Online multi-criteria scheduling;Kubernetes ecosystem,,1,,34,IEEE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Energy consumption;Processor scheduling;Computational modeling;Quality of service;Containers;MCDM;Resource management,0,EC3,2568

Based on the characterization insights, we propose SmartOClock, the first distributed overclocking management platform specifically designed for cloud environments. SmartOClock is a workload-aware scheme that relies on power predictions to heterogeneously distribute the power budgets across its servers based on their needs and then enforce budget compliance locally, per-server, in a decentralized manner. SmartOClock reduces the tail latency by 9%, application cost by 30% and total energy consumption by 10% for latencysensitive microservices on a 36-server deployment. Simulation analysis using production traces show that SmartOClock reduces the number of power capping events by up to 95% while increasing the overclocking success rate by up to 62%.

We find that cloud compute servers cause the majority of emissions in a general-purpose cloud. Thus, we motivate designing carbon-efficient compute server SKUs, or GreenSKUs, using recently-available low-carbon server components. To this end, we design and build three GreenSKUs using low-carbon components, such as energy-efficient CPUs, reused old DRAM via CXL, and reused old SSDs.We detail several challenges that limit GreenSKUs, carbon savings at scale and may prevent their adoption by cloud providers. To address these challenges, we develop a novel methodology and associated framework, GSF (GreenSKU Framework), that enables a cloud provider to systematically evaluate a GreenSKU's carbon savings at scale. We implement GSF within Microsoft Azure's production constraints to evaluate our three GreenSKUs' carbon savings. Using GSF, we show that our most carbon-efficient GreenSKU reduces emissions per core by 28 % compared to currently-deployed cloud servers. When designing GreenSKUs to meet applications' performance requirements, we reduce emissions by 15 %.

Therefore, in the presence of varying network conditions, it is necessary to optimally execute the available task of end users while maximizing the energy efficiency in edge platform and we also need to provide fair Quality-of-Service (QoS). On the other hand, it is necessary to schedule the microservices dynamically to minimize the total network delay and network price.

To enable data-intensive network services and support advanced analytics, many network operators have proposed to integrate MEC systems with network function virtualization (NFV) consolidating virtual network functions (VNFs) and edge capabilities on a shared infrastructure. As of yet, this integration is not fully established, with various architectural issues currently open, even at standardization level. For instance, any update to VNFs deployed in a MEC system requires a time-consuming manual effort, which affects the overall infrastructure operations. To address these pitfalls, VNFs can be decomposed into microservices, which maintain their own states and exhibit different resource consumption requirements. This article presents an approach to integration that leverages serverless computing to merge MEC and NFV at the system level and to deploy VNFs on demand, by combining MEC functional blocks with an NFV orchestrator using a Kubernetes cluster. We further investigate whether the resource utilization of a MEC system can be improved by leveraging networked FPGA-enabled MEC servers, through an extension of the edge layer that takes advantage of available programmable hardware. We quantitatively evaluate and demonstrate the improvement of 75% end-to-end latency, 99.96% VNF execution time, 26.9% resource utilization, and 15.8% energy consumption in comparison with traditional baselines of cloud, edge, and serverless-edge test cases for a high-definition real-time video streaming application.",,Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)(grant numbers:16/SP/3804); Enable Research Programme;,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9145582,Edge computing;networked FPGA;serverless computing;virtual network functions (VNFs) and data security,,36,,52,IEEE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hardware;Internet of Things;Field programmable gate arrays;Streaming media;Servers;Task analysis;Quality of service,0,IC4,42

Therefore, these are increasingly overwhelming the efforts of network administrators as they try to design, reconfigure and manage such networks. Relying on humans to manage such complex and dynamic networks is becoming unsustainable. Network automation promises to reduce the cost of administration and maintenance of network infrastructure, by offering networks the capability to manage themselves. Network automation is the ability of the network to manage itself. Various standardization organizations are taking the initiative in introducing network automation, such as European Telecommunication Standardization Institute (ETSI). ETSI is leading the standardization activities for network automation. It has provided different versions of reference architecture called generic autonomic network architecture (GANA), which describes a four-level abstraction for network-management decision elements (DEs), protocol level, function level, node level, and network level.

In this article, we present a fine-grained microservice orchestration approach to provide services online for dynamic requests of IoT applications.

Serverless computing shows potential for meeting this requirement by scaling idle containers to zero energy-efficiency and cost, but this will lead to a cold start delay. Most solutions rely on idle containers, which necessitates dynamic request time forecasting and container execution monitoring. Furthermore, Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) can provide autonomous and sustainable solutions by combining IIoT with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve this problem. Therefore, we develop a new testbed, CAPTAIN, to facilitate AI-based co-simulation of scalable and flexible serverless computing in IIoT environments. The AI module in the CAPTAIN framework employs Random Forest (RF) and Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models to optimize cold start frequency and prevent cold starts based on their prediction results. The proxy module additionally monitors the client-server network and constantly updates the AI module training dataset via a message queue. Finally, we evaluated the proxy module's performance using a predictive maintenance-based real-world IIoT application and the AI module's performance in a realistic serverless environment using a Microsoft Azure dataset. The AI module of the CAPTAIN outperforms baselines in terms of cold start frequency, computational time with 0.5 milliseconds, energy consumption with 1161.0 joules, and CO2 emissions with 32.25e-05 gCO2.

Using a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, we compare the performance of disaggregation at rack-scale and pod-scale over selected electrical, optical and hybrid network topologies relative to a traditional DC. Relative to a pod-scale DC, the results show that physical disaggregation at rack-scale is sufficient for optimal efficiency when the optical network topology is adopted, and resource components are allocated in a suitable manner. The optical network topology also enables optimal energy efficiency in composable DCs. The paper also studies logical disaggregation of traditional DC servers over an optical network topology. Relative to physical disaggregation at rack-scale, logical disaggregation of server resources within each rack enables marginal fall in the total DC power consumption (TDPC) due to improved resource demands placement. Hence, an adaptable composable infrastructure that can support both in memory (access) latency sensitive and insensitive workloads is enabled. We also conduct a study of the adoption of micro-service architecture in both traditional and composable DCs. Our results show that increasing the modularity of workloads improves the energy efficiency in traditional DCs, but disproportionate utilization of DC resources persists. A combination of disaggregation and micro-services achieved up to 23% reduction in the TDPC of the traditional DC by enabling optimal resources utilization and energy efficiencies.

This promises to make 6G networks more agile, cost-effective, energy-efficient, and resilient. It opens up a plethora of novel use cases, ranging from ubiquitous support for autonomous devices to cost-effective expansions in regions previously underserved.

This article proposes a novel CEI framework for sensor-based applications, exploiting serverless computing for data management and ML tasks. Small-scale model training occurs at the edge with local data for quick prediction response, while large-scale models are trained in the cloud with the full sensor network data, and then, they are fed back to edge nodes for a progressive accuracy improvement.

Results show that local execution is more economic with less complex algorithms and small input data. When it comes to remote execution, REST is the most economic choice followed by Socket.

Datacenters rely on fast, efficient Software Data Planes (SDPs), which orchestrate data transfer between applications and I/O devices. Modern data planes are user-level software stacks, wherein cores spin-poll a large number of queues to avoid the attendant overheads of kernel-based I/O. Cores often poll empty queues before finding work in non-empty ones. Interrogating empty queues hurts peak throughput, tail latency, and energy efficiency as it often entails fruitless cache misses. In this work, we propose HyperPlane, an efficient accelerator for the notification mechanism of SDPs. The key features of HyperPlane are (1) avoiding iteration over empty I/O queues, unlike software-only designs, resulting in queue scalability, (2) halting execution when I/O queues are idle, leading to work proportionality and energy efficiency, and (3) efficiently sharing queues across cores to enjoy strong theoretical properties of scale-up queuing. HyperPlane is realized through a hardware subsystem associated with a familiar programming model. HyperPlane's microarchitecture consists of a monitoring set that watches for work arrival from I/O, and a ready set, which tracks ready queues and distributes work to cores based on various service policies and priority levels.

In the interest of programmer productivity and ease of scaling, workloads in data centers have shifted from single monolithic processes toward a micro and nanoservice software architecture. As a result, single servers are now packed with many threads executing the same, relatively small task on different data.State-of-the-art data centers run these microservices on multi-core CPUs. However, the flexibility offered by traditional CPUs comes at an energy-efficiency cost. The Multiple Instruction Multiple Data execution model misses opportunities to aggregate the similarity in contemporary microservices. We observe that the Single Instruction Multiple Thread execution model, employed by GPUs, provides better thread scaling and has the potential to reduce frontend and memory system energy consumption. However, contemporary GPUs are ill-suited for the latency-sensitive microservice space.To exploit the similarity in contemporary microservices, while maintaining acceptable latency, we propose the Request Processing Unit (RPU). The RPU combines elements of out-of-order CPUs with lockstep thread aggregation mechanisms found in GPUs to execute microservices in a Single Instruction Multiple Request (SIMR) fashion. To complement the RPU, we also propose a SIMR-aware software stack that uses novel mechanisms to batch requests based on their predicted control-flow, split batches based on predicted latency divergence and map per-request memory allocations to maximize coalescing opportunities.

While prior works propose management techniques to mitigate this inefficiency, we tackle it at its root with AgileWatts (AW): a new deep CPU core C-state architecture optimized for datacenter server processors targeting latency-sensitive applications.AW drastically reduces the transition latency from deep CPU core idle power states while retaining most of their power savings based on three key ideas. First, AW eliminates the latency (several microseconds) of saving/restoring the core context when powering-off/-on the core in a deep idle state by i) implementing medium-grained power-gates, carefully distributed across the CPU core, and ii) retaining context in the power-ungated domain. Second, AW eliminates the flush latency (several tens of microseconds) of the L1/L2 caches when entering a deep idle state by keeping L1/L2 content power-ungated. A small control logic also remains ungated to serve cache coherence traffic. AW implements cache sleep-mode and leakage reduction for the power-ungated domain by lowering a core's voltage to the minimum operational level. Third, using a state-of-the-art power efficient all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) clock generator, AW keeps the PLL active and locked during the idle state, cutting microseconds of wake-up latency at negligible power cost.Our evaluation with an accurate industrial-grade simulator calibrated against an Intel Skylake server shows that AW reduces the energy consumption of Memcached by up to 71% (35% on average) with &lt;1% end-to-end performance degradation. We observe similar trends for other evaluated services (MySQL and Kafka). AW's new deep C-states C6A and C6AE reduce transition-time by up to 900× as compared to the deepest existing idle state C6, while consuming only 7% and 5% of the active state (C0) power, respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,EC3,2321

Existing CPU power-saving techniques degrade the performance of these applications due to the long transition latency (order of 100μs) to wake up from a deep CPU idle state (C-state). For this reason, server vendors recommend only enabling shallow core C-states (e.g., CC1) for idle CPU cores, thus preventing the system from entering deep package C-states (e.g., PC6) when all CPU cores are idle. This choice, however, impairs server energy proportionality since power-hungry resources (e.g., IOs, uncore, DRAM) remain active even when there is no active core to use them. As we show, it is common for all cores to be idle due to the low average utilization (e.g., 5 – 20%) of datacenter servers running user-facing applications.We propose to reap this opportunity with AgilePkgC (APC), a new package C-state architecture that improves the energy proportionality of server processors running latency-critical applications. APC implements PC1A (package C1 agile), a new deep package C-state that a system can enter once all cores are in a shallow C-state (i.e., CC1) and has a nanosecond-scale transition latency. PC1A is based on four key techniques. First, a hardware-based agile power management unit (APMU) rapidly detects when all cores enter a shallow core C-state (CC1) and triggers the system-level power savings control flow. Second, an IO Standby Mode (IOSM) places IO interfaces (e.g., PCIe, DMI, UPI, DRAM) in shallow (nanosecond-scale transition latency) low-power modes. Third, a CLM Retention (CLMR) mode rapidly reduces the CLM (Cache-and-home-agent, Last-level-cache, and Mesh network-on-chip) domain's voltage to its retention level, drastically reducing its power consumption. Fourth, APC keeps all system PLLs active in PC1A to allow nanosecond-scale exit latency by avoiding PLL re-locking overhead.Combining these techniques enables significant power savings while requiring less than 200ns transition latency, &gt;250× faster than existing deep package C-states (e.g., PC6), making PC1A practical for datacenter servers. Our evaluation based on an Intel Skylake-based server shows that APC reduces the energy consumption of Memcached by up to 41% (25% on average) with &lt;0.1% performance degradation. APC provides similar benefits for other representative workloads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,IC4,121

In this paper, we observe that modern server-class processors are inefficiently utilized in serverless environments. Cores perform frequent context switches within function invocations and have a high degree of oversubscription. In such an environment, functions frequently lose their micro-architectural state in stateful hardware structures like caches, TLBs, and branch predictors, causing performance degradation. At the same time, modern processors are dimensioned for the needs of a broad set of applications, rendering them suboptimal for serverless workloads. Based on these insights, we propose Mosaic, an architecture optimized for serverless environments that maintains generality to efficiently support other workloads. Mosaic has two components: (1) MosaicCPU, a processor architecture that efficiently runs both serverless workloads and traditional monolithic applications, and (2) MosaicScheduler, a software stack for serverless systems that maximizes the benefits of MosaicCPU. MosaicCPU slices micro-architectural structures into small chunks and assigns tiles of such chunks to functions. The processor retains the state of functions in their tiles across context switches, thereby improving performance. Furthermore, currently-inactive tiles are set to a low power mode, thereby reducing energy consumption. In addition, MosaicScheduler maximizes efficiency by introducing predictive right-sizing of the per-function tiles, alongside with smart scheduling based on the state of the tiles. Overall, compared to conventional server-class processors, Mosaic improves the throughput of serverless workloads by 225% while using 22% less power.",979-8-3503-5057-9,"NSF(grant numbers:CNS 1956007,CCF 2107470,CCF 2316233); Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC); DARPA; ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10764517,Cloud computing;Serverless computing;Hardware partitioning,,,,91,IEEE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Context;Schedules;Program processors;Processor scheduling;Full stack;Serverless computing;Computer architecture;Throughput;Rendering (computer graphics);Optimization,0,EC3,2170

To address the capacity requirements resulting from the huge growth in mobile data traffic, the mobile network operators (MNOs) are adding more base stations and allocating more spectrum layers including outdoor and indoor small cells. Since the capacity requirement of the network varies over time, the scaling up of the network may increase the energy consumption of the Radio Access Network (RAN). Hence, we need to optimize the network to reduce the overall power consumption through Cloud based models, and deployment of power-efficient radio nodes. In this paper, we analyze the network evolution towards Cloud based Radio Access Network (CRAN) for a heterogeneous set of base stations such as those with Macro RRUs, Micro RRUs and Pico radio units. We derive the computational complexity using a flexible and ‘future-proof’ power model and apply it for the network. We also compare the computation complexity for various cases of User Equipment (UE) channel conditions, different sub-components within the given base station type and provide the results. We further use the Bin-Packing algorithm to analyze the number of base station cloud servers needed for this network and the power consumption of the base station cloud.

The pattern promises substantial performance gains, but can also lead to significant drawbacks such as increased development effort and application complexity. So far, there is little to no rigorously acquired knowledge to judge whether applying Request Bundling is worth the costs in a given Microservice architecture. To improve this situation, we performed an empirical study based on a Microservice-based open source business application using realistic workload scenarios. To estimate the performance impact of Request Bundling, we derived a regression model and performed a multivariate regression analysis. These selected regression models can help distributed system engineers and architects to estimate the gain in performance, in terms of round-trip time, with or without Request Bundling.

However, such applications are computation-intensive and energy-consuming, imposing great difficulties to edge servers with limited computing resources, energy supply, and cooling capabilities. To reduce delay and energy consumption in edge, efficient microservice orchestration is necessary, but significantly challenging. Due to frequent communications among multiple microservices, service deployment and request routing are tightly-coupled, which motivates a complex joint optimization problem. When considering multi-instance modeling and fine-grained orchestration for massive microservices, the difficulty is extremely enlarged. Nevertheless, previous work failed to address the above difficulties. Also, they neglected to balance delay and energy, especially lacking dynamic energy-saving abilities. Therefore, this paper minimizes energy and delay by jointly optimizing microservice deployment and request routing via multi-instance modeling, fine-grained orchestration, and dynamic adaptation. Our queuing network model enables accurate end-to-end time analysis covering queuing, computing, and communicating delays. We then propose a delay-aware reinforcement learning algorithm, which derives the static service deployment and routing decisions.

However, achieving efficient resource and energy consumption while meeting the latency requirement in the ECM environment remains challenging. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is a common technique to address this issue. It adjusts the CPU frequency and voltage to balance energy cost and performance. However, selecting the optimal CPU frequency depends on the nature of the microservice workload (e.g., CPU-bound, memory-bound, or mixed). Moreover, various microservices with different latency requirement can be deployed on the same edge node. This makes the DVFS application extremely challenging, particularly for a chip-wide DVFS implementation for which CPU cores operate at the same frequency and voltage.

As the decisions are time-sensitive in nature, the generation of these decisions should incur minimum latency and high accuracy. Further, scalability and extension of the coverage of the entire Safe-aaS platform are also necessary. Considering road transportation as the application scenario, we propose Safe-aaS, which is a microservices- and deep learning-based platform for provisioning ultra-low latency safety services to the end-users in a 6G scenario. We design the proposed solution in two stages. In the first stage, we develop the microservices-enabled application layer to improve the scalability and adaptability of the traditional Safe-aaS platform. Moreover, we apply the state space model to represent the decision parameters requested and the decision delivered to the end-users.

The microservice architecture enables the decomposition of a service into multiple independent, fine-grained microservices working independently. With MEC, microservices can be placed on Edge Service Providers (ESPs) dynamically, responding quickly and reducing service latency and resource consumption. However, the burgeoning of IoV leads to high computation and resource overheads, making service resource requirements an imminent issue. What’s more, due to the limited computation power of ESPs, they can only host a few services. Therefore, ESPs should judiciously decide which services to host. In this paper, we propose a Microservice-oriented Service Placement (MOSP) mechanism for MEC-enabled IoV to shorten service latency, reduce high resource consumption levels and guarantee long-term sustainability. Specifically, we formulate the service placement as an integer linear programming program, where service placement decisions are collaboratively optimized among ESPs, aiming to address spatial demand coupling, service heterogeneity, and decentralized coordination in MEC systems. MOSP comprises an upper layer to map the service requests to ESPs and a lower layer to adjust the service placement of ESPs.

In this systems integration study, we develop and evaluate the novel XDP-Monitoring Energy-Adaptive Network Functions (X-MAN) framework for managing the CPU operational states (P-states) so as to reduce the power consumption while prioritizing low-latency service. Architecturally, X-MAN consists of lightweight traffic monitors that are attached to the virtual network interfaces in the kernel space for per-CNF traffic monitoring and a power manager in user space with a global view of the CNFs on a CPU core.

We evaluate X-MAN through extensive measurements in a real physical testbed operating at up to 10 Gbps. We find that X-MAN incurs significantly shorter and more consistent monitoring latencies for the CPU utilization than a state-of-the-art CPU hardware counter approach.

NFV decouples network functions from hardware devices. This decoupling allows network services, called Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs), to be hosted on commodity hardware which simplifies and enhances service deployment and management for providers, improves flexibility, and leads to efficient and scalable resource usage, and lower costs. The proper placement of VNFs in the hosting infrastructures is one of the main technical challenges. This placement significantly influences the network’s performance, reliability, and operating costs. The VNF placement is NP-Hard. Therefore, there is a need for placement methods that can cope with the complexity of the problem and find appropriate solutions in a reasonable duration. The primary purpose of this study is to provide a taxonomy of optimization techniques used to tackle the VNF placement problems. We classify the studied papers based on performance metrics, methods, algorithms, and environment. Virtualization is not limited to simply replacing physical machines with virtual machines or VNFs, but may also include micro-services, containers, and cloud-native systems. In this context, the second part of our article focuses on the placement of Containers Network Functions (CNFs) in edge/fog computing.

Provisioning resources to serverless services, however, poses several challenges, due to the high cold-start latency of containers and stringent Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements of the microservices. In response, we investigate the behavior of containers in different states (i.e., running, warm, or cold) and exploit our experimental observations to formulate an optimization problem that minimizes the energy consumption of the active servers while reducing SLA violations. In light of the problem complexity, we propose a low-complexity algorithm, named AiW, which utilizes a multi-queueing approach to balance energy consumption and system performance by reusing containers effectively and invoking cold-starts only when necessary. To further minimize the energy consumption of data centers, we introduce the two-timescale COmputing resource Management at the Edge (COME) framework, comprising an orchestrator running our proposed AiW algorithm for container provisioning and Dynamic Server Provisioner (DSP) for dynamically activating/deactivating servers in response to AiW's decisions on request scheduling. COME addresses the mismatch in timescales for resource provisioning decisions at the container and server levels. Extensive performance evaluation through simulation shows AiW's close match to the optimum and COME's significant reduction in power consumption by 22-64% compared state-of-the-art alternatives. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",,,,Cloud Computing Services; Edge Computing; Energy-aware Management; Orchestration,,,,,,,,"Adeppady, Madhura (57435100000); Conte, Alberto (8688261400); Giaccone, Paolo (55222154600); Karl, Holger (7101711052); Chiasserini, Carla Fabiana (7004886008)",57435100000; 8688261400; 55222154600; 7101711052; 7004886008,2024,IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,,,,,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85209387259&doi=10.1109%2fTNSM.2024.3497155&partnerID=40&md5=194332a05c569de08bf598f33679b575,Article in press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85209387259,Edge computing; Energy utilization; Information management; Cloud computing services; Cold-start; Dynamic management; Edge computing; Energy aware; Energy-aware management; Energy-consumption; Orchestration; Servicelevel agreement (SLA); Time-scales; Cloud platforms,0,IC4,39

These objects will produce a significant amount of data. The traditional cloud computing architecture aims to process data in the cloud. As a result, a significant amount of data needs to be communicated to the cloud. This creates a number of challenges, such as high communication latency between the devices and the cloud, increased energy consumption of devices during frequent data upload to the cloud, high bandwidth consumption, while making the network busy by sending the data continuously, and less privacy because of less control on the transmitted data to the server. Fog computing has been proposed to counter these weaknesses. Fog computing aims to process data at the edge and substantially eliminate the necessity of sending data to the cloud. However, combining the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) with the fog computing architecture is still an open challenge. In this paper, we propose to decompose services to create linked-microservices (LMS). Linked-microservices are services that run on multiple nodes but closely linked to their linked-partners. Linked-microservices allow distributing the computation across different computing nodes in the IoT architecture. Using four different types of architectures namely cloud, fog, hybrid, and fog+cloud, we explore and demonstrate the effectiveness of service decomposition by applying four experiments to three different type of datasets.

As such, there is an urgent need for strategies that enable limited server CPU architectures (a.k.a ""SKUs"") to provide performance and energy efficiency over diverse microservices.

We develop a tool, μSKU, that automates search over a soft-SKU design space using A/B testing in production and demonstrate how it can obtain statistically significant gains (up to 7.2% and 4.5% performance improvement over stock and production servers, respectively) with no additional hardware requirements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,microservice; resource fungibility; soft SKU,0,IC4,90

Hence, these frameworks suffer from microservice agnostic scheduling and colossal container over-provisioning, especially during workload fluctuations, thereby resulting in poor resource utilization.In this work, we quantify the above shortcomings using a variety of workloads on a multi-node cluster managed by the Kubernetes and Brigade serverless framework. To address them, we propose Fifer — an adaptive resource management framework to efficiently manage function-chains on serverless platforms. The key idea is to make Fifer (i) utilization conscious by efficiently bin packing jobs to fewer containers using function-aware container scaling and intelligent request batching, and (ii) at the same time, SLO-compliant by proactively spawning containers to avoid cold-starts, thus minimizing the overall response latency. Combining these benefits, Fifer improves container utilization and cluster-wide energy consumption by 4× and 31%, respectively, without compromising on SLO's, when compared to the state-of-the-art schedulers employed by serverless platforms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,scheduling; serverless; resource-management; queuing,0,IC4,80

On the convergence of these trends, the paper makes the observation that for serverless functions, the overhead of accessing dissaggregated storage overshadows the gains from accelerators. Therefore, to benefit from all these trends in conjunction, we propose In-Storage Domain-Specific Acceleration for Serverless Computing (dubbed DSCS-Serverless1). The idea contributes a server-less model that utilizes a programmable accelerator embedded within computational storage to unlock the potential of acceleration in disaggregated datacenters.

Given the large adoption of these systems, several works have been proposed to detect performance anomalies starting from analysing the execution traces. However, most of the proposed approaches rely on machine learning (ML) algorithms to detect anomalies. While ML methods may be effective in detecting anomalies, the training and deployment of these systems as been shown to be less efficient in terms of time, computational resources, and energy required.In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on Context-free grammar for anomaly detection of microservice systems execution traces. We employ the SAX encoding to transform execution traces into strings. Then, we select strings encoding anomalies, and for each possible anomaly, we build a Context-free grammar using the Sequitur grammar induction algorithm. We test our approach on two real-world datasets and compare it with a Logistic Regression classifier. We show how our approach is more effective in terms of training time of 15 seconds with a minimum loss in effectiveness of 5% compared to the Logistic Regression baseline.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,anomaly detection; context-free grammar; execution traces; micro service system,0,IC4,132

These characteristics render existing energy-saving idle CPU sleep states ineffective due to the performance overhead caused by the state’s transition latency. Besides the state transition latency, another important contributor to the performance overhead of sleep states is the cold-start latency, or in other words, the time required to warm up the microarchitectural state (e.g., cache contents, branch predictor metadata) that is flushed or discarded when transitioning to a lower-power state. Both the transition latency and cold-start latency can be particularly detrimental to the performance of latency critical applications with short execution times. While prior work focuses on mitigating the effects of transition and cold-start latency by optimizing request scheduling, in this work we propose a redesign of the core C-state architecture for latency-critical applications. In particular, we introduce C6Awarm, a new Agile core C-state that drastically reduces the performance overhead caused by idle sleep state transition latency and cold-start latency while maintaining significant energy savings. C6Awarm achieves its goals by (1) implementing medium-grained power gating, (2) preserving the microarchitectural state of the core, and (3) keeping the clock generator and PLL active and locked. Our analysis for a set of microservices based on an Intel Skylake server shows that C6Awarm manages to reduce the energy consumption by up to 70% with limited performance degradation (at most 2%).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,microservices; datacenters; Power management; C-states; idle states,0,IC4,109

The adoption of edge computing can contribute to the low latency interaction between CAVs and the metaverse. Microservices are widely deployed on edge networks and the cloud nowadays. User's requests from CAVs are typically fulfilled through the composition of microservices, which may be hosted by contiguous edge nodes. Requests may differ on their required resources at runtime. Consequently, when requests are continuously injected into edge networks, the usage of heterogenous resources, including CPU, memory, and network bandwidth, may not be the same, or differ significantly, on certain edge nodes. This happens especially when burst requests are injected into the network to be satisfied concurrently. Therefore, the usage of heterogenous resources provided by edge nodes should be co-optimized through re-scheduling microservices. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a Web 3.0-enabled Microservice Re-Scheduling approach (called MRS), which is a migration-based mechanism integrating a placement strategy. Specifically, we formulate the microservice re-scheduling task as a multi-objective and multi-constraint optimization problem, which can be solved through a penalty signal-integrated framework and an improved pointer network. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets. Evaluation results show that our MRS performs better than the counterparts with improvements of at least 7.7%, 2.4% and 2.2% in terms of network throughput, latency and energy consumption.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs); Heterogenous Resources Co-Optimization; Metaverse; Microservice Re-Scheduling; Web 3.0,0,IC4,30

This work proposes a new smart street lighting system that adaptively changes the street lights' intensity based on traffic and weather conditions and provides a platform for monitoring road conditions and detecting lamp faults. The system transfers the data using the UDP protocol over NBIoT radio technology. It also maintains two-way communication between the luminaires and the central node. In order to ensure real-time response to traffic and avoid dimming delays, each light is locally controlled by a microcontroller based on the sensed traffic and weather data. The measurements of each luminaire are also sent to the central control node to locate lamp faults, detect emergency situations, and, if needed, broadcast on/off messages to the whole network's luminaires. The system was implemented in a suburban street in Ras Al Khaimah. Evaluations proved that the system can locate and detect faulty lamps and vary the light intensity in real time based on traffic.

Devices in the IoT network are often geared towards mobility and compact in size, thus having a rather weak hardware configuration. There are many light weight protocols, tailor-made suitable for limited processing power and low energy consumption, of which MQTT is the typical one. The current MQTT protocol supports three types of quality-of-service (QoS) and the user has to trade-off the security of the packet transmission by transmission rate, bandwidth and energy consumption. The MQTT protocol, however, does not support packet storage mechanisms which means that when the receiver is interrupted, the packet cannot be retrieved. In this paper, we present a broker-less SIP-MBA Platform, designed for micro-service and using gRPC protocol to transmit and receive messages. This design optimizes the transmission rate, power consumption and transmission bandwidth, while still meeting reliability when communicating. Besides, we implement users and things management mechanisms with the aim of improving security issues. Finally, we present the test results by implementing a collect data service via gRPC protocol and comparing it with streaming data by using the MQTT protocol. © 2021.

The IoHT-MBA Platform is considered the backbone of every IoT architecture, so the optimal design of the IoHT-MBA Platform is essential issue, which should be carefully considered in the different aspects. Although, IoT is applied in multiple domains, however, there are still three main features that are challenge to improve: i) data collection, ii) users, devices management, and iii) remote device control. Today’s medical IoT systems, often too focused on the big data or access control aspects of participants, but not focused on collecting data accurately, quickly, and efficiently; power redundancy and system expansion. This is very important for the medical sector - which always prioritizes the availability of data for therapeutic purposes over other aspects. In this paper, we introduce the IoHT Platform for Healthcare environment which is designed by microservice and brokerless architecture, focusing strongly on the three aforementioned characteristics. In addition, our IoHT Platform considers the five other issues including (1) the limited processing capacity of the devices, (2) energy saving for the device, (3) speed and accurate of the data collection, (4) security mechanisms and (5) scalability of the system. Also, in order for the IoHT Platform to be suitable for the field of health monitoring, we also add realtime alerts for the medical team. In the evaluation section, moreover, we describe the evaluation to prove the effectiveness of the proposed IoHT Platform (i.e. the proof-of-concept) in the performance, non-error, and non affected by geographical distance.

We introduced an automated system capable of regulating the internal greenhouse environment, which underwent testing across 30 days in September 2021, with temperatures ranging from 26°C to 31°C and humidity from 65% to 70%. The system consistently monitored and adjusted the microclimate, with sensors capturing temperature and humidity data at 30-second intervals, amassing over 83,000 data entries for enhanced control accuracy. The automated regulation effectively maintained desired humidity, significantly reducing nighttime levels by 80% while carefully increasing daytime humidity to counteract external heat. Temperature control was largely successful, sustaining daytime levels around 32°C, but faced challenges in maintaining the target of 26°C during cooler nights. Energy consumption was optimized, with the automation leading to a significant 4–33% energy saving for cooling and an 8% saving in heating compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the system was accessible via a web interface, allowing for real-time climate tracking and prompt anomaly identification. In conclusion, the developed greenhouse automation system exhibited efficiency in equipment usage and improved temperature and humidity control. Further enhancements are required for lamp-based heating. This research contributes to the efficiency and reliability of greenhouse automation systems, mitigating risks associated with external environmental factors and enhancing stability, productivity, and disease and pest prevention. © 2023.

The remote rehabilitation training data are transmitted via a wireless channel (4G or Wi-Fi network), accumulated, and analyzed on the microservices of the developed hardware and software complex. The results of each personal training are displayed on the user's gadgets (smartphone, laptop, etc.) in real-time. Implemented electronic components and architecture of the developed devices are based on a cost-effective Arduino platform hardware. Using of “Reflex Txx” series’ devices, in addition to conventional physiotherapy, gives positive shifts in treatment after only 150 minutes of the entire trial during even short-term (1 week) exercise. © 2021 MEDIC SCIENTIFIC.

Various algorithms have been proposed in order to reduce the total number of required servers and network devices. The practice developed in response to the problem of server sprawl, a situation in which multiple, under-utilized servers (and/or network devices) take up more space and consume more resources than the ones justified by their workload; with the effect to power off unused equipment. Generally, consolidation mechanisms consider different parameters related to the services neglecting the specific function of the Virtual Machines (VMs) in the application framework (e.g., core component, backup replica, member of a set of workers for load balancing). In this work, we develop a new consolidation algorithm that takes into account the particular function of each VM with the aim to apply power saving mechanisms without compromising the desired service level. The results of the simulations show that it is possible to obtain significant energy savings. In particular, we show, with different heuristics, the optimal trade-off between service level and power efficiency achieved by the proposed model. © 2017 ITC Press.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Carrega, Alessandro (36633941300); Repetto, Matteo (57194639871)",36633941300; 57194639871,2017,"Proceedings of the 29th International Teletraffic Congress, ITC 2017",8065706,24,29,5,6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040237525&doi=10.23919%2fITC.2017.8065706&partnerID=40&md5=c8494f78800f2081eac4dbf0130af96d,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040237525,Economic and social effects; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Power management; Application frameworks; Cloud applications; Consolidation mechanisms; Core components; Efficient strategy; Network devices; Power efficiency; Power saving mechanism; Green computing,0,EC3,1927

Yet novel usage scenarios shift their roles from basic data acquisition and forwarding to performing more sophisticated tasks such as data processing, local service provisioning and actuation. To meet their goals, horizontal or vertical collaboration and task distribution are often required; utilizing resources identified in the nearby communication environment or offered by remote, cloud- or edge-based services. However, different infrastructural and energy-related constraints can severely influence device's communication capabilities thus dictating the level of provided functionality. In this paper, we focus on the class of ubiquitous systems without permanent communication links, utilizing only sporadic communication with global computing infrastructure. Such systems exploit the short-term presence of third-party communication and computational resources in their environment, adapting their service level to available resource properties. Several identified communication and computation scenarios are described for such a resource constrained and time-variable environment, along with the incentive model for using and provisioning of short-term resources.

At today, around 75% of global energy is consumed in urban areas, so efforts must be addressed to transform existing urban energy systems into more sustainable systems. In this perspective, a key aspect to evolve toward a cleaner and affordable energy system is the development of Multi-Energy Systems (MES) modelling, whereby heat, electricity, fuels, transport, and other energy carriers closely interact with each other at various scales. MES can optimize technical, economic and environmental performance with respect to “traditional” independent energy systems, at both the operational and the planning stage. This paper presents a development of the existing MESsi modelling platform, consisting in the implementation of a model estimating the impacts on air quality and human health. MESsi is a novel distributed infrastructure for modelling and co-simulating Multi-Energy-Systems. It exploits modern software design patterns (i.e. microservices) to guarantee scalability, extendibility and easy maintenance of the system. Thus, MESsi is flexible in modelling and co-simulating different energy flows in a single solution made of different interoperable modules that can be deployed in a plug-and-play fashion. The module to be implemented in MESsi infrastructure is the DIATI integrated dispersion and externalities model (DIDEM). The DIDEM model is based on the impact pathway approach, linking the simulation of pollutants dispersion to the concentration-exposure-response functions provided by latest WHO recommendations. An overview of the potential integration steps in the modelling infrastructure is described in this paper. A discussion on possible application scenarios that have different spatio-temporal resolutions is also reported. The integration of DIDEM model in MESsi platform allows the inter-connection of a detailed impact assessment to a high-level energy system simulation. © 2018 WIT Press.",,,,Air pollution; Health effects; Impact pathway approach; Modelling; Multi-energy systems,,,,,,,,"Ravina, Marco (56622864600); Patti, Edoardo (56090685400); Bottaccioli, Lorenzo (57035415200); Panepinto, Deborah (35368852200); Acquaviva, Andrea (7003693404); Zanetti, Maria Chiara (57220337752)",56622864600; 56090685400; 57035415200; 35368852200; 7003693404; 57220337752,2018,WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment,,95,106,11,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057173917&doi=10.2495%2fAIR180091&partnerID=40&md5=440effc86f7ecbe53c060bc7a25bd6c7,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057173917,,0,IC4 but doesn't seem relevant,2193

Unlike existing surveys, for the first time, we comprehensively sort out and analyze the development landscape of workload prediction from a new perspective, i.e., application-oriented rather than prediction methodologies per se. Specifically, we first introduce the basic features of workload prediction, and then analyze and categorize existing efforts based on two significant characteristics of cloud applications: variability and heterogeneity.

The importance of cloud data centers has expanded dramatically in the previous decade, and they are now regarded as the backbone of the modern economy. Cloud-based microservices architecture is incorporated by firms such as Netflix, Twitter, eBay, Amazon, Hailo, Groupon, and Zalando. Such cloud computing arrangements deal with the parallel deployment of data-intensive workloads in real time. Moreover, commonly utilized cloud services such as the web and email require continuous operation without interruption. For that purpose, cloud service providers must optimize resource management, efficient energy usage, and carbon footprint reduction. This study presents a conceptual framework to manage the high amount of microservice execution while reducing response time, energy consumption, and execution costs. The proposed framework suggests four key agent services: (1) intelligent partitioning: responsible for microservice classification; (2) dynamic allocation: used for pre-execution distribution of microservices among containers and then makes decisions for dynamic allocation of microservices at runtime; (3) resource optimization: in charge of shifting workloads and ensuring optimal resource use; (4) mutation ac-tions: these are based on procedures that will mutate the microservices based on cloud data center workloads. The suggested framework was partially evaluated using a custom-built simulation envi-ronment, which demonstrated its efficiency and potential for implementation in a cloud computing context. The findings show that the engrossment of suggested services can lead to a reduced number of network calls, lower energy consumption, and relatively reduced carbon dioxide emissions. © 2022 by the authors.

Consequently, researchers have promoted the development of sustainable software with new development methods and tools to lessen its hardware demands. However, the approaches developed so far lack cohesiveness along the stages of the software development life cycle (SDLC) and exist outside of a holistic method for green software development (GSD). In addition, there is a severe lack of approaches that target the analysis and design stages of the SDLC, leaving software architects and designers unsupported. In this article, we introduce our behavior-based consumption profile (BBCP) external Domain-Specific Language (DSL), aimed at assisting software architects and designers in modeling the behavior of software. The models generated with our external DSL contain multiple sets of properties that characterize features of the software’s behavior. In contrast to other modeling languages, our BBCP emphasizes how time and probability are involved in software execution and its evolution over time, helping its users to gather an expectation of software usage and hardware consumption from the initial stages of software development. To illustrate the feasibility and benefits of our proposal, we conclude with an analysis of the model of a software service created using the BBCP, which is simulated using Insight Maker to obtain an estimation of hardware consumption and later translated to energy consumption. © 2024 by the authors.",,,,behavior with software; green software; SOA; software behavior; software engineering; software profiling,,,,,,,,"Larracoechea, Jorge Andrés (57221960959); Ilarri, Sergio (7801631434); Roose, Philippe (55843683500)",57221960959; 7801631434; 55843683500,2024,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),7456,,,,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203852902&doi=10.3390%2fapp14177456&partnerID=40&md5=764572cb721393b46c5d6d5cbbf1be5c,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85203852902,Program translators; Software design; Behavior with software; Behavior-based; Energy-consumption; Green software; SOA; Software architects; Software behavior; Software development life-cycle; Software execution; Software profiling; Green development,0,EC3 but may be useful,88

Thanks to the development of the IoT, researchers have devoted themselves to technologies that convert a conventional home into an intelligent occupants-aware place to manage electric resources with autonomous devices to deal with excess energy consumption and providing a comfortable living environment. There are studies to supplement the innate shortcomings of the IoT and improve intelligence by using cloud computing and machine learning. However, the machine learning-based autonomous control devices lack flexibility, and cloud computing is challenging with latency and security. In this paper, we propose a rule-based optimization mechanism on an embedded edge platform to provide dynamic home appliance control and advanced intelligence in a smart home. To provide actional control ability, we design and developed a rule-based objective function in the EdgeX edge computing platform to control the temperature states of the smart home. Compared to cloud computing, edge computing can provide faster response and higher quality of services. The edge computing paradigm provides better analysis, processing, and storage abilities to the data generated from the IoT sensors to enhance the capability of IoT devices concerning computing, storage, and network resources. In order to satisfy the paradigm of distributed edge computing, all the services are implemented as microservices. The microservices are connected to each other through REST APIs based on the constrained IoT devices to provide all the functionalities that accomplish a trade-off between energy consumption and occupant-desired environment setting for the smart home appliances. We simulated our proposed system to control the temperature of a smart home; through experimental findings, we investigated the application against the delay time and overall memory consumption by the embedded edge system of EdgeX. The result of this research work suggests that the implemented services operated efficiently in the raspberry pi 3 hardware of IoT devices. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

However, this data is not useful unless it is available on-time for services that discover meaningful information in order to provide intelligent decisions. The microservices-based data caching, data virtualization, data processing, data analysis, and data ingestion methods can be applied to enhance the data availability for energy efficiency management services provision across buildings. To foster building energy efficiency management services (BEEMS), Web of Objects (WoO) provides data abstraction, aggregation, and ingestion mechanism with virtual objects (VOs) and composite virtual objects (CVOs) by using ontologies and availability and scalability of services with microservices. This article proposes the use of data processing microservices modeling to enhance data availability and expose services capabilities with microservices for BEEMS.

Because of their complex nature, they cannot be approached solely through analytical modeling, hence the inefficiency of most classical modeling approaches. In this article, a Hybrid Approach based on both systemic and analytical modeling is presented and applied to a case study. From this novel approach, a model—the Multi-Institution Building Energy System—is presented. It allowed us to highlight and detail the need for greater governance of energy systems. The socio-technical solutions identified to answer the issues of governance (Accuracy, Reliability and Fairness) were DevOps methodology and the use of Distributed Microservices Architecture. Based on this framework, the design of a Decision Support System assuring and exploiting state-of-the-art scalable tools for data management and machine learning factories is described in this article. Moreover, we wish to set up the conceptual basis necessary for the design of a generic theoretical framework of optimization applicable to complex socio-technical systems in the context of the management of a shared resource. © 2022 by the authors.",,,,automated machine learning; clustering; complex system; DevOps; monitoring; profiling; recommender system; smart grid,,,,,,,,"Lévy, Loup-Noé (57203503916); Bosom, Jérémie (57202512390); Guerard, Guillaume (55746242400); Amor, Soufian Ben (16642317200); Bui, Marc (7006594623); Tran, Hai (57196641853)",57203503916; 57202512390; 55746242400; 16642317200; 7006594623; 57196641853,2022,Energies,5516,,,,7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136460397&doi=10.3390%2fen15155516&partnerID=40&md5=6308ccd8a038ff7efa1a6d18f2229463,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85136460397,Analytical models; Decision support systems; Electric power transmission networks; Information management; Machine learning; Monitoring; Automated machine learning; Automated machines; Clusterings; Energy systems; Machine-learning; Profiling; Smart energy systems; Smart grid; Sociotechnical; Technological change; Smart power grids,0,EC3,2056

However, implementing a smart agriculture system encounters challenges such as the high latency and bandwidth consumption linked to cloud computing, Internet disconnections in rural locales, and the imperative of cost efficiency for farmers. Addressing these hurdles, this paper advocates a fog-based smart agriculture infrastructure integrating edge computing and LoRa communication. We tackle farmers’ prime concern of animal intrusion by presenting a solution leveraging low-cost PIR sensors, cameras, and computer vision to detect intrusions and predict animal locations using an innovative algorithm. Our system detects intrusions pre-emptively, identifies intruders, forecasts their movements, and promptly alerts farmers. Additionally, we compare our proposed strategy with other approaches and measure their power consumptions, demonstrating significant energy savings afforded by our strategy. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness, energy efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of our system compared to state-of-the-art systems. © 2024 by the authors.",,,,animal intrusion detection; fog computing; LoRa; smart agriculture,,,,,,,,"Miao, Jinpeng (58558229700); Rajasekhar, Dasari (58359144600); Mishra, Shivakant (7402725656); Nayak, Sanjeet Kumar (55811613100); Yadav, Ramanarayan (58558811400)",58558229700; 58359144600; 7402725656; 55811613100; 58558811400,2024,Future Internet,296,,,,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85202290186&doi=10.3390%2ffi16080296&partnerID=40&md5=afe75154a8168a5efc000ea5ccffad49,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85202290186,Fog computing; Agriculture systems; Animal intrusion detection; Bandwidth consumption; Cloud-computing; Cost-efficiency; Crop quality; Intrusion-Detection; Lora; Operational efficiencies; Smart agricultures; Smart agriculture,0,IC4,126

All these concerns are currently highlighted due to the strong increase in the purchase/sale of products on online platforms, as well as the requirements for stricter food security and safety. Thus, this study aims to increase the global awareness of agro-industrial micro, small, and medium size enterprises for the adoption of innovative food solutions though industry digitalization (Industry 4.0), associated logistics and circular economy, with a concern for cybersecurity and products information, communication and shelf-life extension. The adoption of these guidelines will certainly foster along the complete food chain (from producer to consumer, with all intermediary parties) the awareness on environmentally sustainable technological solutions for the post-harvest food supply chain, and thus, promoting the future food sustainability required by the population increase, the climate change, the exodus of rural population to urban areas, and food loss and waste. © 2021 by the authors.

10.3390/s20082418,3105,Trilles S.; González-Pérez A.; Huerta J.,An IoT platform based on microservices and serverless paradigms for smart farming purposes,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nowadays, the concept of “Everything is connected to Everything” has spread to reach increasingly diverse scenarios, due to the benefits of constantly being able to know, in real-time, the status of your factory, your city, your health or your smallholding. This wide variety of scenarios creates different challenges such as the heterogeneity of IoT devices, support for large numbers of connected devices, reliable and safe systems, energy efficiency and the possibility of using this system by third-parties in other scenarios. A transversal middleware in all IoT solutions is called an IoT platform. the IoT platform is a piece of software that works like a kind of “glue” to combine platforms and orchestrate capabilities that connect devices, users and applications/services in a “cyber-physical” world. In this way, the IoT platform can help solve the challenges listed above. This paper proposes an IoT agnostic architecture, highlighting the role of the IoT platform, within a broader ecosystem of interconnected tools, aiming at increasing scalability, stability, interoperability and reusability. For that purpose, different paradigms of computing will be used, such as microservices architecture and serverless computing. Additionally, a technological proposal of the architecture, called SEnviro Connect, is presented. This proposal is validated in the IoT scenario of smart farming, where five IoT devices (SEnviro nodes) have been deployed to improve wine production.

Cities can be viewed as a microcosm of interconnected “objects” with which citizens interact daily, which represents an extremely interesting example of a cyber physical system (CPS), where the continuous monitoring of a city’s status occurs through sensors and processors applied within the real-world infrastructure. Each object in a city can be both the collector and distributor of information regarding mobility, energy consumption, air pollution as well as potentially offering cultural and tourist information. As a consequence, the cyber and real worlds are strongly linked and interdependent in a smart city. New services can be deployed when needed, and evaluation mechanisms can be set up to assess the health and success of a smart city. In particular, the objectives of creating ICT-enabled smart city environments target (but are not limited to) improved city services; optimized decision-making; the creation of smart urban infrastructures; the orchestration of cyber and physical resources; addressing challenging urban issues, such as environmental pollution, transportation management, energy usage and public health; the optimization of the use and benefits of next generation (5G and beyond) communication; the capitalization of social networks and their analysis; support for tactile internet applications; and the inspiration of urban citizens to improve their quality of life. However, the large scale deployment of cyber-physical-social systems faces a series of challenges and issues (e.g., energy efficiency requirements, architecture, protocol stack design, implementation, and security), which requires more smart sensing and computing methods as well as advanced networking and communications technologies to provide more pervasive cyber-physical-social services. In this paper, we discuss the challenges, the state-of-the-art, and the solutions to a set of currently unresolved key questions related to CPSs and smart cities. © 2021 by the authors.

As the population of cities grows and their environmental impact becomes more evident, the European strategy aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions—the main cause of climate change. Measures to reduce the impact of climate change include reducing energy consumption, improving mobility, harnessing resources and renewable energies, integrating nature-based solutions and efficiently managing infrastructure. The monitoring and control of all this activity is essential for its proper functioning. In this context, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) plays a key role in the digitisation, monitoring, and managing of these different verticals. Urban data platforms support cities on extracting Key Performance Indicators (KPI) in their efforts to make better decisions. Cities must be transformed by applying efficient urban planning measures and taking into account not only technological aspects, but also by applying a holistic vision in building solutions where citizens are at the centre. In addition, standardisation of platforms where applications are integrated as one is necessary. This requires interoperability between different verticals. This article presents the information platform developed for the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz in Spain. The platform is based on the UNE 178104 standard to provide a holistic architecture that integrates information from the different urban planning measures implemented in the city. The platform was constructed in the context of the SmartEnCity project following the urban transformation strategy established by the city. The article presents the value-added solutions implemented in the platform. These solutions have been developed by applying co-creation techniques in which stakeholders have been involved throughout the process. The platform proposes a step forward towards standardization, harmonises the integration of data from multiple vertical, provides interoperability between services, and simplifies scalability and replicability due to its microservice architecture. © 2021 by the authors.

Many tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, and Facebook as deploying their data centres around the world to provide computation and storage services. The customers either submit their job directly or they take the help of the brokers for the submission of the jobs to the cloud centres. The preliminary aim is to reduce the overall power consumption which was ignored in the early days of cloud development. This was due to the performance expectations from cloud servers as they were supposed to provide all the services through their services layers IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. As time passed and researchers came up with new terminologies and algorithmic architecture for the reduction of power consumption and sustainability, other algorithmic anarchies were also introduced, such as statistical oriented learning and bioinspired algorithms. In this paper, an indepth focus has been done on multiple approaches for migration among virtual machines and find out various issues among existing approaches. The proposed work utilizes elastic scheduling inspired by the smart elastic scheduling algorithm (SESA) to develop a more energy-efficient VM allocation and migration algorithm. The proposed work uses cosine similarity and bandwidth utilization as additional utilities to improve the current performance in terms of QoS.

To supplement cloud services, computationally intensive applications can be distributed on resource-constrained mobile devices by leveraging underutilized nearby resources to meet the latency and bandwidth requirements of application execution. Building upon this premise, it is necessary to investigate idle or underutilized resources that are present at the edge of the network. The utilization of a microservice architecture in IoT application development, with its increased granularity in service breakdown, provides opportunities for improved scalability, maintainability, and extensibility. In this research, the proposed schedule tackles the latency requirements of applications by identifying suitable upward migration of microservices within a multi-tiered fog computing infrastructure. This approach enables optimal utilization of network edge resources. Experimental validation is performed using the iFogSim2 simulator and the results are compared with existing baselines.

In this respect, micro-electrical mechanical system (MEMS) sensors are widely used in several applications, including structural health monitoring (SHM), in which accelerometric samples are acquired to perform modal analysis. Thanks to their significantly lower cost, ease of installation in the structure, and lower power consumption, they enable extensive, pervasive, and battery-less monitoring systems. This paper presents an innovative high-performance device for SHM applications, based on a low-noise triaxial MEMS accelerometer, providing a guideline and insightful results about the opportunities and capabilities of these devices. Sensor nodes have been designed, developed, and calibrated to meet structural vibration monitoring and modal identification requirements. These components include a protocol for reliable command dissemination through network and data collection, and improvements to software components for data pipelining, jitter control, and high-frequency sampling. Devices were tested in the lab using shaker excitation. Results demonstrate that MEMS-based accelerometers are a feasible solution to replace expensive piezo-based accelerometers. Deploying MEMS is promising to minimize sensor node energy consumption. Time and frequency domain analyses show that MEMS can correctly detect modal frequencies, which are useful parameters for damage detection. The acquired data from the test bed were used to examine the functioning of the network, data transmission, and data quality. The proposed architecture has been successfully deployed in a real case study to monitor the structural health of the Marcus Aurelius Exedra Hall within the Capitoline Museum of Rome. The performance robustness was demonstrated, and the results showed that the wired sensor network provides dense and accurate vibration data for structural continuous monitoring. © 2024 by the authors.",,,,internet of things; SHM-board; structural health monitoring; ultra-low-power micro-controller,,,,,,,,"Crognale, Marianna (57216584986); Rinaldi, Cecilia (57216581359); Potenza, Francesco (23397637500); Gattulli, Vincenzo (6603769681); Colarieti, Andrea (35203077700); Franchi, Fabio (57193013263)",57216584986; 57216581359; 23397637500; 6603769681; 35203077700; 57193013263,2024,Sensors,2435,,,,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85191410430&doi=10.3390%2fs24082435&partnerID=40&md5=3d73e116b65ac9a4e5a8404e4105540a,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85191410430,Accelerometers; Damage detection; Energy utilization; Frequency domain analysis; Internet of things; Modal analysis; Sensor nodes; Structural dynamics; Lower noise; Micro controller; Micro-electrical mechanical systems; Monitoring sensors; Performance; Sensing technology; Structural health monitoring-board; Structural systems; Ultra-low power; Ultra-low-power micro-controller; accelerometer; article; data quality; diagnosis; energy consumption; health survey; human; internet of things; Italy; MEMS accelerometer; microelectromechanical system; noise; protocol; sensor; software; vibration; Structural health monitoring,0,EC3,3024
10.3390/su16135738,2540,Soongpol B.; Netinant P.; Rukhiran M.,Practical Sustainable Software Development in Architectural Flexibility for Energy Efficiency Using the Extended Agile Framework,,,,,,,,,,,,"Many regular business operations are transforming into digital services, increasing advanced multi-platforms, rapid operational alignment, flexibility, and environmental impact through energy consumption, hardware waste, and technology investments. Flexible and sustainable system development models emphasizing energy efficiency can help innovate software development as digital servicing applications shift. This research is motivated by the need to improve energy consumption in early software design and development due to rising technological efficiency and sustainability demands. Although effective in iterative development and stakeholder engagement, traditional Agile methodologies often struggle with long-term sustainability and energy efficiency. Extended Agile, combining Agile, layered architecture, and aspect-oriented frameworks (ALAI), promises to improve system modularity, flexibility, maintainability, and sustainability. This study’s findings are not just theoretical, but also practically relevant, as they explore the energy efficiency of ALAI software development methodologies, using graduate admission information system services (GAISS) as an example. GAISS is a complex system that handles the entire process of graduate admissions, from application submission to final decision. The study quantifies the energy usage of a student-list webpage by analyzing Microsoft IIS server logs from February 2022 to May 2024. Directly applicable findings show that the GAISS based on the ALAI framework reduces energy consumption by 10.7914% compared to traditional Agile software developments. ALAI used 892.80 kWh versus Agile’s 1000.80 kWh during operations, saving energy. These findings demonstrate the benefits of integrating aspect-oriented frameworks and layering approaches into Agile methodologies, contributing to sustainable software development discourse. The study emphasizes the importance of energy-efficient frameworks such as ALAI to reduce software systems’ environmental impact and promote software development sustainability.

,10,"Attarha, Shadi; Forster, Anna","Empowering IoT Applications with Flexible, Energy-Efficient Remote Management of Low-Power Edge Devices",Proceedings of the 2023 International Conference on Embedded Wireless Systems and Networks,,,,2023,EWSN '23,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA","In the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), reliable and energy-efficient provision of IoT applications has become critical. Equipping IoT systems with tools that enable a flexible, well-performing, and automated way of monitoring and managing IoT edge devices is an essential prerequisite. In current IoT systems, low-power edge appliances have been utilized in a way that can not be controlled and re-configured in a timely manner. Hence, conducting a trade-off solution between manageability, performance and design requirements are demanded. This paper introduces a novel approach for fine-grained monitoring and managing individual micro-services within low-power edge devices, which improves system reliability and energy efficiency. The proposed method enables operational flexibility for IoT edge devices by leveraging a modularization technique. Following a review of existing solutions for remote-managed IoT services, a detailed description of the suggested approach is presented. Also, to explore the essential design principles that must be considered in this approach, the suggested architecture is elaborated in detail. Finally, the advantages of the proposed solution to deal with disruptions are demonstrated in the proof of concept-based experiments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IoT; Energy Efficiency; Low-power; Operational Flexibility; Service Isolation; Service Management,0,IC4,29
