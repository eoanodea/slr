I am screening papers for a systematic literature review.
The topic of the systematic review is energy efficiency and energy consumption in microservice architectures.
The study should focus exclusively on this topic.

I give 2 examples with title and abstract that should be included.
Example 1:

- Title: Energy-Aware Microservices: A Survey and Future Directions
- Abstract: This paper surveys the state of the art in energy-aware microservice architectures, focusing on measurement techniques and architectural patterns for improving energy efficiency.

Example 2:

- Title: Measuring and Optimizing Power Consumption in Containerized Microservices
- Abstract: We present a framework for measuring and optimizing power consumption in microservice-based applications deployed in containers, with a focus on software-level strategies.

Exclude the article if any of the following criteria are true:

- EC4 - Only discusses energy at hardware/infrastructure level, not software/architecture.
- EC5 - No mention of measurement, analysis, or evaluation of energy in microservices.
- EC6 - The paper is a secondary study (SLR, mapping studies...)

Include the article if any of the following criteria are true: - IC5 - Title/abstract indicates energy efficiency/consumption is considered in software engineering or architecture.

- IC6 - Title/abstract refers to solutions for energy-efficient microservices.

Decide if the article should be included or excluded from the systematic review.
I give the title and abstract of the article as input.
Only answer INCLUDE or EXCLUDE, and the IC or EC ID (e.g. 'Include - IC5').
Be lenient. I prefer including papers by mistake rather than excluding them by mistake.

Paper Title: A comprehensive survey on software-defined networking for smart communities
Abstract: The need to provide services closer to the end-user proximity leads to the exchange of a large volume of data generated from the smart devices deployed at different geo-distributed sites. The massive amount of data generated from the smart devices need to be transmitted, analyzed, and processed. This requires seamless data exchanges among geo-separated nodes, which results in a considerable burden on the underlying network infrastructure and can degrade the performance of any implemented solution. Therefore, a dynamic, agile, and programmable network management paradigm is required. To handle the challenges mentioned above, software-defined networking (SDN) gained much attention from academia, researchers, and industrial sectors. Shifting the computational load from forwarding devices to a logically centralized controller is a dream of every network operator who wants to have complete control and global visibility of the network. Also, the concept of network functions virtualization (NFV) in SDN controller is required to increase resource utilization efficiency. Thus, in this paper, a comprehensive survey on SDN for various smart applications is presented. This survey covers the infrastructural details of SDN hardware and OpenFlow switches, controllers, simulation tools, programming languages, open issues, and challenges in SDN implementation with advanced technologies such as 5G and microservices. In addition, the challenges on the control plane and data plane are highlighted in detail, such as fault tolerance, routing, scheduling of flows, and energy consumption on OpenFlow switches. Finally, various open issues and challenges future scope of SDN are discussed and analyzed in the proposal. Â© 2022 The Authors.
