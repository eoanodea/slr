Kounev,Online Power Consumption Estimation for Functions in Cloud Applications,2019 IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC),,2474-0756,,12-Sep-19,,,,,IEEE,,"The growth of cloud services leads to more and more data centers that are increasingly larger and consume considerable amounts of power. To increase energy efficiency, informed decisions on workload placement and provisioning are essential. Micro-services and the upcoming serverless platforms with more granular deployment options exacerbate this problem. For this reason, knowing the power consumption of the deployed application becomes crucial, providing the necessary information for autonomous decision making. However, the actual power draw of a server running a specific application under load is not available without specialized measurement equipment or power consumption models. Yet, granularity is often only down to machine level and not application level. In this paper, we propose a monitoring and modeling approach to estimate power consumption on an application function level. The model uses performance counters that are allocated to specific functions to assess their impact on the total power consumption. Hence our model applies to a large variety of servers and for micro-service and serverless workloads. Our model uses an additional correction to minimize falsely allocated performance counters and increase accuracy. We validate the proposed approach on real hardware with a dedicated benchmarking application. The evaluation shows that our approach can be used to monitor application power consumption down to the function level with high accuracy for reliable workload provisioning and placement decisions.",978-1-7281-2411-7,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8831214,"Energy efficiency, serverless, micro-services, code offloading, DevOps",,5,,38,IEEE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Power demand;Data centers;Power measurement;Load modeling;Monitoring;Hardware;Software,0,IC4,41

To develop sustainability-aware software, green metrics have been implemented to estimate the energy consumed by the execution of an application. However, they have a rebound energy consumption effect because they require an application to be executed to estimate the energy consumed after each change. To address this problem, it is necessary to construct energy estimation models that do not require the execution of applications. This work addresses this problem by constructing a green model based on size, complexity and duplicated lines to estimate the energy consumed by model-view-controller applications without their execution. This article defines a model constructed based on 52 applications. The results were accurate in twelve applications, which showed that the joule estimation was very close to reality, avoiding the energy consumed by the execution of applications. © 2023, The Author(s).",,,,Architectural patterns; Energy consumption estimation; Green software; Model-view controller (MVC); Software architectures,,,,,,,,"Guamán, Daniel (57188566526); Pérez, Jennifer (37043795900); Valdiviezo-Diaz, Priscila (36186316400)",57188566526; 37043795900; 36186316400,2023,Journal of Supercomputing,,13766,13793,27,2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151338800&doi=10.1007%2fs11227-023-05202-6&partnerID=40&md5=647088e011dc284be3e69deeef20d643,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85151338800,Application programs; Controllers; Software architecture; Architectural pattern; Energy; Energy consumption estimation; Energy-consumption; Green metrics; Green software; Information and Communication Technologies; Model-view controller; Zero emission; Energy utilization,0,IC4,75
10.1109/CLOUD60044.2023.00067,2818,Alzahrani A.; Tang M.,A Microservice-based SaaS Deployment in a Data Center Considering Computational Server and Network Energy Consumption,,,,,,,,,,,,"In a data center, deploying a microservice-based SaaS will result in a spike in energy usage, since the computation servers where the microservices are deployed will consume more energy as a result of an increase in computation workload. The data center's communications network will also consume more energy due to the increased communication among the microservices of the SaaS. Due to the fact that microservice-based SaaS deployment is handled by the developer of the microservice-based SaaS and can only be deployed on virtual machines rented by the developer, this issue cannot be taken into account in traditional microservice-based SaaS deployment methods. In this paper, a new microservice-based SaaS deployment method is proposed. The new approach relies on the data center determining where microservices should be deployed. The new microservice-based SaaS deployment method considers the energy increase in the computation servers and in the communication network. The microservice-based SaaS deployment problem is a combinatorial optimization problem. Thus, a genetic algorithm with repairing mechanism is proposed to solve the problem. Compared to traditional deployment approach, the proposed method is capable of reducing the energy consumption associated with microservice-based SaaS deployment by 37.55%. © 2023 IEEE.",,,,Cloud computing; Data center; Deployment; Energy consumption; Genetic algorithm; Microservice; Optimization; Software as a Service,,,,,,,,"Alzahrani, Amal (57219756909); Tang, Maolin (55367854400)",57219756909; 55367854400,2023,"IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing, CLOUD",,505,515,10,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174232361&doi=10.1109%2fCLOUD60044.2023.00067&partnerID=40&md5=d89946513257dd6a282402d48f461af4,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85174232361,Genetic algorithms; Green computing; Software as a service (SaaS); Cloud-computing; Communications networks; Datacenter; Deployment; Deployment methods; Energy; Energy-consumption; Microservice; Optimisations; Software-as-a- Service (SaaS); Energy utilization,0,IC4,24

Ding,Application-Oriented Cloud Workload Prediction: A Survey and New Perspectives,Tsinghua Science and Technology,,1007-0214,,11-Sep-24,,,,,TUP,,"Workload prediction is critical in enabling proactive resource management of cloud applications. Accurate workload prediction is valuable for cloud users and providers as it can effectively guide many practices, such as performance assurance, cost reduction, and energy consumption optimization. However, cloud workload prediction is highly challenging due to the complexity and dynamics of workloads, and various solutions have been proposed to enhance the prediction behavior. This paper aims to provide an in-depth understanding and categorization of existing solutions through extensive literature reviews. Unlike existing surveys, for the first time, we comprehensively sort out and analyze the development landscape of workload prediction from a new perspective, i.e., application-oriented rather than prediction methodologies per se. Specifically, we first introduce the basic features of workload prediction, and then analyze and categorize existing efforts based on two significant characteristics of cloud applications: variability and heterogeneity. Furthermore, we also investigate how workload prediction is applied to resource management. Finally, open research opportunities in workload prediction are highlighted to foster further advancements.",,National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62372330);,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10676402,cloud computing;workload prediction;resource management;artificial intelligence for IT operations (AIOps),,1,,117,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Surveys;Measurement;Energy consumption;Costs;Reviews;Taxonomy;Predictive models,0,IC4,114

Pietrantuono,Anomaly Detection and Root Cause Analysis of Microservices Energy Consumption,2024 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS),,2836-3868,,15-Oct-24,,,,,IEEE,,"With the expansion of cloud computing and data centers, the need has arisen to tackle their environmental impact. The increasing adoption of microservice architectures, while offering scalability and flexibility, poses new challenges in the effective management of systems’ energy consumption.This study analyzes experimentally the effectiveness, with respect to energy consumption, of algorithms for Anomaly Detection (AD) and Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for (containerized) microservices systems. The study analyzes five AD and three RCA algorithms. Metrics to assess the effectiveness of AD algorithms are Precision, Recall, and F-Score. For RCA algorithms, the chose metric is Precision at level k. Two subjects of different complexity are used: Sock Shop and UNI-Cloud. Experiments use a cross-over paired comparison design, involving multiple randomized runs for robust measures.The experiments show that AD algorithms exhibit a relatively moderate performance. The mean adjusted Precision for Sock Shop is 61.5%, while it is 75% for the best-performing algorithms (BIRCH, KNN, and SVM) on UNI-Cloud. The Recall and F-Score for UNI-Cloud, for the same algorithms, are 75%, while for Sock Shop KNN yields the best outcome at roughly 45%. MicroRCA and RCD emerge as the top-performing algorithms for RCA.We found that the effectiveness of AD algorithms is strongly influenced by anomaly thresholds, emphasizing the importance of careful tuning such algorithms. RCA algorithms reveal promising results, particularly RCD and MicroRCA, which showed robust performance. However, challenges remain, as seen with the ϵ-diagnosis algorithm, suggesting the need for further refinement.For DevOps engineers, the findings highlight the need to carefully select and tune AD and RCA algorithms for energy, and to take into account system topology and monitoring configurations.",979-8-3503-6855-0,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10707452,Microservices;Energy consumption;Anomaly Detection;Root Cause Analysis,,,,39,IEEE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Measurement;Energy consumption;Root cause analysis;Web services;Software algorithms;Microservice architectures;Nearest neighbor methods;Topology;Anomaly detection;Tuning,1,,7
