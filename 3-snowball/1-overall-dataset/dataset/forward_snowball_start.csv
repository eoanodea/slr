Existing mainstream cloud service providers have prevalently adopted container technologies in their distributed system infrastructures for automated application management. To handle the automation of deployment, maintenance, autoscaling, and networking of containerized applications, container orchestration is proposed as an essential research problem. However, the highly dynamic and diverse feature of cloud workloads and environments considerably raises the complexity of orchestration mechanisms. Machine learning algorithms are accordingly employed by container orchestration systems for behavior modeling and prediction of multi-dimensional performance metrics. Such insights could further improve the quality of resource provisioning decisions in response to the changing workloads under complex environments. In this article, we present a comprehensive literature review of existing machine learning-based container orchestration approaches. Detailed taxonomies are proposed to classify the current researches by their common features. Moreover, the evolution of machine learning-based container orchestration technologies from the year 2016 to 2021 has been designed based on objectives and metrics. A comparative analysis of the reviewed techniques is conducted according to the proposed taxonomies, with emphasis on their key characteristics. Finally, various open research challenges and potential future directions are highlighted.","2022-01-31","2025-10-27 09:36:46","2025-10-27 09:36:46","2025-10-27 09:07:40","1-35","","10s","54","","ACM Comput.

The unique features of this computing model include rapid auto-scaling, strong isolation, fine-grained billing options, and access to a massive service ecosystem, which autonomously handles resource management decisions. This model is increasingly being explored for deployments in geographically distributed edge and fog computing networks as well, due to these characteristics. Effective management of computing resources has always gained a lot of attention among researchers. The need to automate the entire process of resource provisioning, allocation, scheduling, monitoring, and scaling has resulted in the need for specialized focus on resource management under the serverless model. In this article, we identify the major aspects covering the broader concept of resource management in serverless environments and propose a taxonomy of elements that influence these aspects, encompassing characteristics of system design, workload attributes, and stakeholder expectations. We take a holistic view on serverless environments deployed across edge, fog, and cloud computing networks. We also analyse existing works discussing aspects of serverless resource management using this taxonomy. This article further identifies gaps in literature and highlights future research directions for improving capabilities of this computing model.","2022-01-31","2025-10-27 09:36:46","2025-10-27 09:36:46","2025-10-27 09:07:50","1-36","","11s","54","","ACM Comput.

However, to date there is a lack of in-depth survey that would help developers and researchers better understand the significance of serverless computing in different contexts. Thus, it is essential to present research evidence that has been published in this area. In this systematic survey, 275 research papers that examined serverless computing from well-known literature databases were extensively reviewed to extract useful data. Then, the obtained data were analyzed to answer several research questions regarding state-of-the-art contributions of serverless computing, its concepts, its platforms, its usage, etc. We moreover discuss the challenges that serverless computing faces nowadays and how future research could enable its implementation and usage.","2021-07-12","2025-10-27 09:36:46","2025-10-27 09:36:46","2025-10-27 09:07:52","39","","1","10","","J Cloud Comp","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The development of a DL model is a time-consuming and resource-intensive procedure. Hence, dedicated GPU accelerators have been collectively constructed into a GPU datacenter. An efficient scheduler design for such GPU datacenter is crucially important to reduce the operational cost and improve resource utilization. However, traditional approaches designed for big data or high performance computing workloads can not support DL workloads to fully utilize the GPU resources. Recently, substantial schedulers are proposed to tailor for DL workloads in GPU datacenters. This paper surveys existing research efforts for both training and inference workloads. We primarily present how existing schedulers facilitate the respective workloads from the scheduling objectives and resource consumption features. Finally, we prospect several promising future research directions.

The popularity of this paradigm is due to offering a highly transparent infrastructure that enables user applications to scale in the granularity of their functions. Since these often small and single‐purpose functions are managed on shared computing resources behind the scene, a great potential for computational reuse and approximate computing emerges that if unleashed, can remarkably improve the efficiency of serverless cloud systems—both from the user's QoS and system's (energy consumption and incurred cost) perspectives. Accordingly, the goal of this survey study is to, first, unfold the internal mechanics of serverless computing and, second, explore the scope for efficiency within this paradigm via studying function reuse and approximation approaches and discussing the pros and cons of each one. Next, we outline potential future research directions within this paradigm that can either unlock new use cases or make the paradigm more efficient.","2023-10","2025-10-27 09:36:46","2025-10-27 09:36:46","2025-10-27 09:12:26","1853-1886","","10","53","","Softw Pract Exp","Efficiency in the serverless cloud paradigm","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cloud-native computing, as the most influential development principle for web applications, has already attracted increasingly more attention in both industry and academia. Despite the momentum in the cloud-native industrial community, a clear research roadmap on this topic is still missing. As a contribution to this knowledge, this paper surveys key issues during the life-cycle of cloud-native applications, from the perspective of services. Specifically, we elaborate the research domains by decoupling the life-cycle of cloud-native applications into four states: building, orchestration, operate, and maintenance. We also discuss the fundamental necessities and summarize the key performance metrics that play critical roles during the development and management of cloud-native applications. We highlight the key implications and limitations of existing works in each state. The challenges, future directions, and research opportunities are also discussed.","2023-06-26","2025-10-27 09:36:46","2025-10-27 09:36:46","2025-10-27 09:13:33","","","","","","","Cloud-Native Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Software Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The layered storage structure of container images can further reduce the deployment cost and container startup time. Existing researches discuss layer sharing scheduling theoretically but with little attention paid to the practical implementation. To fill in this gap, we propose and implement a Layer-aware and Resource-adaptive container Scheduler (LRScheduler) in edge computing. Specifically, we first utilize container image layer information to design and implement a node scoring and container scheduling mechanism. This mechanism can effectively reduce the download cost when deploying containers, which is very important in edge computing with limited bandwidth. Then, we design a dynamically weighted and resource-adaptive mechanism to enhance load balancing in edge clusters, increasing layer sharing scores when resource load is low to use idle resources effectively. Our scheduler is built on the scheduling framework of Kubernetes, enabling full process automation from task information acquisition to container dep=loyment. Testing on a real system has shown that our design can effectively reduce the container deployment cost as compared with the default scheduler.","2024-12-20","2025-10-27 09:36:46","2025-10-27 09:36:46","2025-10-27 09:15:55","244-251","","","","","","LRScheduler","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","","","","","and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Distributed; Parallel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considering multimedia streaming as one of the most trendy applications in the IT industry, the goal of this study is to develop serverless multimedia streaming engine (SMSE), the first domain‐specific serverless platform for multimedia streaming. SMSE democratizes multimedia service development via enabling content providers (or even end‐users) to rapidly develop their desired functionalities on their multimedia contents. Upon developing SMSE, the next goal of this study is to deal with its efficiency challenges and develop a function container provisioning method that can efficiently utilize cloud resources and improve the users' quality of service. In particular, we develop a dynamic method that provisions durable or ephemeral containers depending on the spatiotemporal and data‐dependency characteristics of the functions. Evaluating the prototype implementation of SMSE under real‐world settings demonstrates its capability to reduce both the containerization overhead, and the makespan time of serving multimedia processing functions (by up to 30%) in compare to the function provision methods that are being used in the general‐purpose serverless cloud systems.","2024-02-15","2025-10-27 09:36:47","2025-10-27 09:36:47","2025-10-27 09:16:10","e7922","","4","36","","Concurrency and Computation","SMSE","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in a serverless environment, functions in the same workflow may be scheduled to different nodes with different caches, which can cause non-intuitive anomalies. This paper presents CausalMesh, a novel approach to causally consistent caching in serverless computing. CausalMesh is the first cache system that supports coordination-free and abort-free read/write operations and read transactions when clients roam among multiple servers. CausalMesh also supports read-write transactional causal consistency in the presence of client roaming but at the cost of abort-freedom.

Accounting for potential runtime variability, developers must size functions for worst-case scenarios to ensure service-level objectives (SLOs), resulting in significant resource inefficiency. To address this issue, we propose Janus, a novel resource adaptation framework for serverless platforms. Janus employs a late-binding approach, allowing function sizes to be dynamically adapted based on runtime conditions. The main challenge lies in the information barrier between the developer and the provider: developers lack access to runtime information, while providers lack domain knowledge about the workflow. To bridge this gap, Janus allows developers to provide hints containing rules and options for resource adaptation. Providers then follow these hints to dynamically adjust resource allocation at runtime based on real-time function execution information, ensuring compliance with SLOs. We implement Janus and conduct extensive experiments with real-world serverless workflows. Our results demonstrate that Janus enhances resource efficiency by up to 34.7% compared to the state-of-the-art.","2025-02-20","2025-10-27 09:36:47","2025-10-27 09:36:47","2025-10-27 09:16:57","","","","","","","It Takes Two to Tango","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Distributed; Parallel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, previous studies have not studied well the issues of significant cold start latency and highly dynamic workloads in serverless function scheduling, which are exacerbated at the resource-limited network edge. In this paper, we formulate the Serverless Function Scheduling (SFS) problem for resource-limited edge computing, aiming to minimize the average response time. To efficiently solve this intractable scheduling problem, we first consider a simplified offline form of the problem and design a polynomial-time optimal scheduling algorithm based on each function's weight. Furthermore, we propose an Enhanced Shortest Function First (ESFF) algorithm, in which the function weight represents the scheduling urgency. To avoid frequent cold starts, ESFF selectively decides the initialization of new function instances when receiving requests. To deal with dynamic workloads, ESFF judiciously replaces serverless functions based on the function weight at the completion time of requests. Extensive simulations based on real-world serverless request traces are conducted, and the results show that ESFF consistently and substantially outperforms existing baselines under different settings.","2023-10-31","2025-10-27 09:36:47","2025-10-27 09:36:47","2025-10-27 09:17:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Distributed; Parallel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, resource allocation for workflows, particularly those with branching structures, is complicated by cold starts and network delays between dependent functions, significantly degrading execution efficiency and response times. In this paper, we propose the Invocation Concurrency Prediction-Based Scaling (ICPS) algorithm to address these challenges. ICPS employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict function concurrency, dynamically pre-warming function instances, and an affinity-based deployment strategy to co-locate dependent functions on the same worker node, minimizing network latency. The experimental results demonstrate that ICPS consistently outperforms existing approaches in diverse scenarios. The results confirm ICPS as a robust and scalable solution for optimizing serverless workflow execution.","2025-04-09","2025-10-27 09:36:47","2025-10-27 09:36:47","2025-10-27 09:18:51","","","","","","","ICPS","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Distributed; Parallel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our analysis highlights two major factors that limit performance: (a) lack of efficient communication methods between the serverless functions in the DAG, and (b) stragglers when a DAG stage invokes a set of parallel functions that must complete before starting the next DAG stage. To address these limitations, we propose WISEFUSE, an automated approach to generate an optimized execution plan for serverless DAGs for a user-specified latency objective or budget. We introduce three optimizations: (1) Fusion combines in-series functions together in a single VM to reduce the communication overhead between cascaded functions. (2) Bundling executes a group of parallel invocations of a function in one VM to improve resource sharing among the parallel workers to reduce skew. (3) Resource Allocation assigns the right VM size to each function or function bundle in the DAG to reduce the E2E latency and cost. We implement WISEFUSE to evaluate it experimentally using three popular serverless applications with different DAG structures, memory footprints, and intermediate data sizes. Compared to competing approaches and other alternatives, WISEFUSE shows significant improvements in E2E latency and cost. Specifically, for a machine learning pipeline, WISEFUSE achieves P95 latency that is 67% lower than Photons, 39% lower than Faastlane, and 90% lower than SONIC without increasing the cost.","2022-05-26","2025-10-27 09:36:47","2025-10-27 09:36:47","2025-10-27 09:21:37","1-28","","2","6","","Proc.

The unique features of this computing model include rapid auto-scaling, strong isolation, fine-grained billing options, and access to a massive service ecosystem, which autonomously handles resource management decisions. This model is increasingly being explored for deployments in geographically distributed edge and fog computing networks as well, due to these characteristics. Effective management of computing resources has always gained a lot of attention among researchers. The need to automate the entire process of resource provisioning, allocation, scheduling, monitoring, and scaling has resulted in the need for specialized focus on resource management under the serverless model. In this article, we identify the major aspects covering the broader concept of resource management in serverless environments and propose a taxonomy of elements that influence these aspects, encompassing characteristics of system design, workload attributes, and stakeholder expectations. We take a holistic view on serverless environments deployed across edge, fog, and cloud computing networks.

One fundamental challenge of doing this in microservice management frameworks, however, is that different components of a service can exhibit significant differences in their impact on end-to-end performance. To make resource management more challenging, a single microservice can be shared by multiple online services that have diverse workload patterns and SLA requirements. We present an efficient resource management system, namely Erms, for guaranteeing SLAs with high probability in shared microservice environments. Erms profiles microservice latency as a piece-wise linear function of the workload, resource usage, and interference. Based on this profiling, Erms builds resource scaling models to optimally determine latency targets for microservices with complex dependencies. Erms also designs new scheduling policies at shared microservices to further enhance resource efficiency. Experiments across microservice benchmarks as well as trace-driven simulations demonstrate that Erms can reduce SLA violation probability by 5× and more importantly, lead to a reduction in resource usage by 1.6×, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.","2024-05-31","2025-10-27 09:36:47","2025-10-27 09:36:47","2025-10-27 09:23:14","1-28","","1-2","42","","ACM Trans.

With latency propagation effects becoming increasingly prominent, step-wise resource tuning is required to address Service-Level-Objectives (SLOs). Modern processors' allowance for fine-grained Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), coupled with serverless workflows' intermittent nature, presents a unique opportunity to reduce power while meeting SLOs. We introduce $\Omega$kypous, an SLO-driven DVFS framework for serverless workflows. $\Omega$kypous employs a grey-box model that predicts functions' execution latency and power under different Core and Uncore frequency combinations. Based on these predictions and the timing slacks between workflow functions, $\Omega$kypous uses a closed-loop control mechanism to dynamically adjust Core and Uncore frequencies, thus minimizing power consumption without compromising predefined end-to-end latency constraints. Our evaluation on real-world traces from Azure, against state-of-the-art power management frameworks, demonstrates an average power consumption reduction of 16\%, while consistently maintaining low SLO violation rates (1.8\%), when operating under power caps.","2025-04-21","2025-10-27 09:36:47","2025-10-27 09:36:47","2025-10-27 09:24:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Distributed; Parallel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One fundamental challenge of doing this in microservice management frameworks, however, is that different components of a service can exhibit significant differences in their impact on end-to-end performance. To make resource management more challenging, a single microservice can be shared by multiple online services that have diverse workload patterns and SLA requirements. We present an efficient resource management system, namely Erms, for guaranteeing SLAs with high probability in shared microservice environments. Erms profiles microservice latency as a piece-wise linear function of the workload, resource usage, and interference. Based on this profiling, Erms builds resource scaling models to optimally determine latency targets for microservices with complex dependencies. Erms also designs new scheduling policies at shared microservices to further enhance resource efficiency. Experiments across microservice benchmarks as well as trace-driven simulations demonstrate that Erms can reduce SLA violation probability by 5× and more importantly, lead to a reduction in resource usage by 1.6×, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.","2024-05-31","2025-10-27 09:36:47","2025-10-27 09:36:47","2025-10-27 09:25:16","1-28","","1-2","42","","ACM Trans.

However, the inherent cold start problem in serverless ML inference systems, particularly the time-consuming model loading process, remains a significant bottleneck. Utilizing pipelined model loading improves efficiency but still suffer from pipeline stalls due to sequential layer construction and monolithic weight loading. In this paper, we propose \textit{Cicada}, a novel pipeline optimization framework that coordinates computational, storage, and scheduling resources through three key mechanisms: (1) \textit{MiniLoader}: which reduces layer construction overhead by opportunistically optimizing parameter initialization; (2) \textit{WeightDecoupler}: decoupling weight file processing from layer construction, enabling asynchronous weight retrieval and out-of-order weight application; (3) \textit{Priority-Aware Scheduler}: dynamically allocating resources to ensure high-priority inference tasks are executed promptly. Our experimental results demonstrate that Cicada achieves significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art PISeL framework. Specifically, Cicada reduces end-to-end inference latency by an average of 61.59\%, with the MiniLoader component contributing the majority of this optimization (53.41\%), and the WeightDecoupler achieves up to 26.17\% improvement. Additionally, Cicada achieves up to 2.52x speedup in the inference pipeline utlization compared to PISeL.","2025-06-28","2025-10-27 09:36:47","2025-10-27 09:36:47","2025-10-27 09:26:35","","","","","","","Cicada","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Distributed; Parallel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We then build a testbed that installed three containerized services with different latency sensitivities for concrete evaluation. Additionally, we adopt real-world data traces from Alibaba and Twitter for large-scale emulations.

Accounting for potential runtime variability, developers must size functions for worst-case scenarios to ensure service-level objectives (SLOs), resulting in significant resource inefficiency. To address this issue, we propose Janus, a novel resource adaptation framework for serverless platforms. Janus employs a late-binding approach, allowing function sizes to be dynamically adapted based on runtime conditions. The main challenge lies in the information barrier between the developer and the provider: developers lack access to runtime information, while providers lack domain knowledge about the workflow. To bridge this gap, Janus allows developers to provide hints containing rules and options for resource adaptation. Providers then follow these hints to dynamically adjust resource allocation at runtime based on real-time function execution information, ensuring compliance with SLOs. We implement Janus and conduct extensive experiments with real-world serverless workflows. Our results demonstrate that Janus enhances resource efficiency by up to 34.7% compared to the state-of-the-art.","2025-02-20","2025-10-27 09:36:48","2025-10-27 09:36:48","2025-10-27 09:27:33","","","","","","","It Takes Two to Tango","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Distributed; Parallel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional approaches often rely on per-request latency metrics, which are highly sensitive to transient noise and fail to reflect the holistic behavior of complex, concurrent workloads. In contrast, window-level P95 tail latency provides a stable and meaningful signal that captures both system-wide trends and user-perceived performance degradation. We identify two key shortcomings in existing methods: (i) inadequate handling of heterogeneous data, where traffic-side features propagate across service dependencies and resource-side signals reflect localized bottlenecks, and (ii) the lack of principled architectural designs that effectively distinguish and integrate these complementary modalities. To address these challenges, we propose USRFNet, a deep learning network that explicitly separates and models traffic-side and resource-side features. USRFNet employs GNNs to capture service interactions and request propagation patterns, while gMLP modules independently model cluster resource dynamics. These representations are then fused into a unified system embedding to predict window-level P95 latency with high accuracy. We evaluate USRFNet on real-world microservice benchmarks under large-scale stress testing conditions, demonstrating substantial improvements in prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines.","2025-08-03","2025-10-27 09:36:48","2025-10-27 09:36:48","2025-10-27 09:28:09","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our preliminary study reveals that inefficient library initialization and usage are major contributors to this latency in Python-based serverless applications. We introduce LibProf, a Python profiler that uses dynamic program analysis to identify inefficient library initializations. LibProf collects library usage data through statistical sampling and call-path profiling, then generates a report to guide developers in addressing four types of inefficiency patterns. Systematic evaluations on 15 serverless applications demonstrate that LibProf effectively identifies inefficiencies.

This restricts performance optimization, cost reduction, and availability of applications. However, orchestrating serverless workflows on Jointcloud FaaS systems faces two main challenges: 1) Additional overhead caused by centralized cross-cloud orchestration; and 2) A lack of reliable failover and fault-tolerant mechanisms for cross-cloud serverless workflows. To address these challenges, we propose Joint$\lambda$, a distributed runtime system designed to orchestrate serverless workflows on multiple FaaS systems without relying on a centralized orchestrator. Joint$\lambda$ introduces a compatibility layer, Backend-Shim, leveraging inter-cloud heterogeneity to optimize makespan and reduce costs with on-demand billing. By using function-side orchestration instead of centralized nodes, it enables independent function invocations and data transfers, reducing cross-cloud communication overhead. For high availability, it ensures exactly-once execution via datastores and failover mechanisms for serverless workflows on Jointcloud FaaS systems. We validate Joint$\lambda$ on two heterogeneous FaaS systems, AWS and ALiYun, with four workflows. Compared to the most advanced commercial orchestration services for single-cloud serverless workflows, Joint$\lambda$ reduces up to 3.3$\times$ latency, saving up to 65\% cost. Joint$\lambda$ is also faster than the state-of-the-art orchestrators for cross-cloud serverless workflows up to 4.0$\times$, reducing up to 4.5$\times$ cost and providing strong execution guarantees.","2025-05-28","2025-10-27 09:36:48","2025-10-27 09:36:48","2025-10-27 09:28:17","","","","","","","Joint$λ$","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Distributed; Parallel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current solutions utilize a warm pool to keep function alive: a warm-start can be analogous to a CPU cache-hit. However, modern cache has multiple hierarchies and the last-level cache is shared among cores, whereas the warm pool is limited to a single tenant for security concerns. Also, the warm pool keep-alive policy can be further optimized using cache replacement algorithms. In this paper, we borrow practical optimizations from caching, and design FaasCamp, a caching-aided multi-tenant serverless computing framework. FaasCamp extends the single-tier warm pool into multi-tiers, with a reclaim pool introduced enabling secure function instance sharing among tenants. Also, FaasCamp leverages machine learning to approximate the optimal cache replacement policy to improve the warm rate. We have implemented a prototype and conducted extensive experiments under multiple scenarios. The results show that FaasCamp can outperform existing platforms with minimal overhead.","2024-08-01","2025-10-27 09:36:48","2025-10-27 09:36:48","2025-10-27 09:28:19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Distributed; Parallel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Container orchestration systems such as Kubernetes, which has become the de facto standard, simplify the deployment of container-based applications. However, developing efficient and well-defined orchestration systems is a challenge. This article focuses specifically on the scheduler, a key orchestrator task that assigns physical resources to containers. Scheduling approaches are designed based on different Quality of Service (QoS) parameters to provide limited response time, efficient energy consumption, better resource utilization, and other things. This article aims to establish insight knowledge into Kubernetes scheduling, find the main gaps, and thus guide future research in the area. Therefore, we conduct a study of empirical research on Kubernetes scheduling techniques and present a new taxonomy for Kubernetes scheduling. The challenges, future direction, and research opportunities are also discussed.","2023-07-31","2025-10-27 09:37:16","2025-10-27 09:37:16","2025-10-21","1-37","","7","55","","ACM Comput.

Prevalently adopted by these systems for task deployments of diverse workloads such as big data, web services, and IoT, they support agile application deployment, environmental consistency, OS distribution portability, application-centric management, and resource isolation. Although most of these systems are mature with advanced features, their optimization strategies are still tailored to the assumption of a static cluster. Elastic compute resources would enable heterogeneous resource management strategies in response to the dynamic business volume for various types of workloads. Hence, we propose a heterogeneous task allocation strategy for cost-efficient container orchestration through resource utilization optimization and elastic instance pricing with three main features. The first one is to support heterogeneous job configurations to optimize the initial placement of containers into existing resources by task packing. The second one is cluster size adjustment to meet the changing workload through autoscaling algorithms. The third one is a rescheduling mechanism to shut down underutilized VM instances for cost saving and reallocate the relevant jobs without losing task progress. We evaluate our approach in terms of cost and performance on the Australian National Cloud Infrastructure (Nectar). Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed strategy could reduce the overall cost by 23% to 32% for different types of cloud workload patterns when compared to the default Kubernetes framework.","2020-05-31","2025-10-27 09:37:16","2025-10-27 09:37:16","2025-10-21","1-24","","2","20","","ACM Trans.

Many research works have proposed autoscaling approaches for microservices, however, less likely concerned with the correctness guarantee of the proposed algorithms. Hence, it is significant to gather and summarize these approaches to foster future innovation. Meanwhile, a few reviews have been published concerning microservices from different aspects. Therefore, our review complements the existing by focusing on autoscaling with verification perspectives. This study highlights the recent contributions in three inter‐related main topics that were published within the year 2017 to 2022, namely, microservice, verification, and autoscaling. Due to limited resources on verification for microservice autoscaling, we widen the perspective by considering the verification for autoscaling in cloud‐based systems. Based on our findings, we found that the formal method is not a new thing in verifying the autoscaling policies in cloud‐based systems, and one recent study that implements the formal method in the microservices area has been identified. Apart from the autoscaling techniques, we have also determined several factors that have been a concern in scaling the microservices as well as the relatable metrics. Meanwhile, from a verification perspective, we identified that probabilistic model checking is the common formal verification technique used to verify microservices and cloud autoscaling. Finally, we recommend open challenges from two perspectives which highlight the verification for existing microservice autoscaling and verification for ML‐based microservice autoscaling.","2022-11","2025-10-27 09:37:16","2025-10-27 09:37:16","2025-10-21","2476-2495","","11","52","","Softw Pract Exp","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Geo distributed cloud data centers act as a backbone for providing fundamental infrastructure for cloud services delivery. Conversely, their high growing energy consumption rate is the major problem to be addressed. Cloud providers are in a hunger to identify different solutions to tackle energy management and carbon emission. In this work, a multi-cloud environment is modeled as geographically distributed data centers with varying solar power generation corresponding to its location, electricity price, carbon emission, and carbon tax. The energy management of the workload allocation algorithm is strongly dependent on the nature of the application considered. The task deadline and brownout information is used to bring in variation in task types. The renewable energy-aware workload allocation algorithm adaptive to task nature is proposed with migration policy to explore its impact on carbon emission, total energy cost, brown and renewable power consumption.","2021-11-17","2025-10-27 09:37:16","2025-10-27 09:37:16","2025-10-21","5677-5689","","5","41","","Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cloud service providers strive to provide high quality of service (QoS) and response time is one of the key QoS attributes for microservices. The dynamism of microservice ecosystems necessitates runtime adaptations and microservices rescheduling to avoid performance degradation. Existing works target rescheduling in hypervisor‐based systems, while ignoring the influence of configuration parameters of container‐based microservices. In an effort to address these challenges, this article describes a novel microservice rescheduling framework, throttling and interaction‐aware anticorrelated rescheduling for microservices, to proactively perform rescheduling activities whilst ensuring timely service responses. Based on periodic monitoring of the performance attributes, the framework schedules container migrations. Considering the exponentially large solution space, a metaheuristic approach based on multiverse optimization is developed to generate the near‐optimal mapping of microservices to the datacenter resources. Experimental results indicate that our framework provides superior performance with a reduction of up to 13.97% in the average response time, when compared with systems with no support for rescheduling.","2021-09-10","2025-10-27 09:37:16","2025-10-27 09:37:16","2025-10-21","e6290","","17","33","","Concurrency and Computation","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is possible to adopt less energy-intensive strategies and consume electricity produced by renewable energy to limit the increase in carbon emissions. In this paper, we present a review of the workload-shifting techniques available for sustainable workload deployment, providing an innovative framework that can be used to analyze energy-aware approaches that apply any type of shifting technique. We identified three main concepts: compute a workload at a different time, deploy a workload and/or its data in a different location, or use alternative processing to provide a good-enough option for a workload. A definition and some examples are given for each shifting concept, and then we explore the opportunities and challenges of combining different shifting techniques.","2025-10-03","2025-10-27 09:37:17","2025-10-27 09:37:17","2025-10-21","3769301","","","","","ACM Comput.

When multiple versions (or “ flavours ”) of a component are available, application managers must select a flavour for each deployed component, and assign these components to specific nodes, all while considering constraints such as dependencies, quality of service (QoS), budget, operational costs, and carbon emissions. In complex scenarios, finding the optimal deployment is often infeasible for human operators without automated tools to systematically explore the solution space. To address this challenge, we introduce FREEDA, a first constraint optimisation approach for deploying constrained and multi-flavoured applications on Cloud-Edge infrastructure topologies. We demonstrate the practical feasibility of FREEDA through experiments on a variety of realistic Cloud-Edge infrastructural topologies and component architectures. Furthermore, we benchmark FREEDA against Zephyrus, a comparable tool employing the same underlying solving technology. Empirical results show that FREEDA achieves strong scalability across a broad spectrum of realistic configurations and consistently outperforms Zephyrus.","2025-07-30","2025-10-27 09:37:17","2025-10-27 09:37:17","2025-10-21","3757061","","","","","ACM Trans.

So far, most carbon-aware strategies have focused on leveraging the flexibility of scheduling decisions for batch processing by shifting the time and location of workload executions. However, such approaches cannot be applied to service-oriented cloud applications, since they have to be reachable at every point in time and often at low latencies. We propose a carbon-aware approach for operating microservices under hourly carbon budgets. By choosing the most appropriate version and horizontal scaleout for each microservice, our strategy maximizes user experience and revenue while staying within budget constraints. Experiments across various application configurations and carbon budgets demonstrate that the approach adapts properly to changing workloads and carbon intensities.","2025-06-26","2025-10-27 09:37:17","2025-10-27 09:37:17","2025-10-21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Distributed; Parallel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This leaves applications vulnerable to Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS) attacks, designed to force service withdrawal via draining the target of the financial means to support the application. With the public cloud market projected to reach three quarters of a trillion dollars USD by the end of 2025, this is a major consideration. In this paper, we develop a theoretical model to reason about EDoS attacks on K8s. We determine scaling thresholds based on Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), incorporating costs of operating K8s replicas, Service Level Agreement violations, and minimum service charges imposed by billing structures. We build on top of the MDP model a Stackelberg game, determining the circumstances under which an adversary injects traffic. The optimal policy returned by the MDP is generally of hysteresis-type, but not always. Specifically, through numerical evaluations we show examples where charges on an hourly resolution eliminate incentives for scaling down resources. Furthermore, through the use of experiments on a realistic K8s cluster, we show that, depending on the billing model employed and the customer workload characteristics, an EDoS attack can result in a 4× increase in traffic intensity resulting in a 3.6× decrease in efficiency. Interestingly, increasing the intensity of an attack may render it less efficient per unit of attack power. Finally, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept for a countermeasure involving custom scaling metrics where autoscaling decisions are randomized. We demonstrate that per-minute utilization charges are reduced compared to standard scaling, with negligible drops in requests.","2025-05-27","2025-10-27 09:37:17","2025-10-27 09:37:17","2025-10-21","1-29","","2","9","","Proc.

In particular, Architecture-based Performance Prediction (AbPP) assesses the performance for future scenarios (e.g., alternative workload, design, deployment) without expensive measurements for all such alternatives. However, accurate AbPP requires an up-to-date architectural Performance Model (aPM) that is parameterized over factors impacting the performance (e.g., input data characteristics). Especially in agile development, keeping such a parametric aPM consistent with software artifacts is challenging due to frequent evolutionary, adaptive, and usage-related changes. Existing approaches do not address the impact of all aforementioned changes. Moreover, the extraction of a complete aPM after each impacting change causes unnecessary monitoring overhead and may overwrite previous manual adjustments. In this article, we present the Continuous Integration of architectural Performance Model (CIPM) approach, which automatically updates a parametric aPM after each evolutionary, adaptive, or usage change. To reduce the monitoring overhead, CIPM only calibrates the affected performance parameters (e.g., resource demand) using adaptive monitoring. Moreover, a self-validation process in CIPM validates the accuracy, manages the monitoring to reduce overhead, and recalibrates inaccurate parts. Consequently, CIPM will automatically keep the aPM up-to-date throughout the development and operation, which enables AbPP for a proactive identification of upcoming performance problems and for evaluating alternatives at low costs. We evaluate the applicability of CIPM in terms of accuracy, monitoring overhead, and scalability using six cases (four Java-based open source applications and two industrial Lua-based sensor applications). Regarding accuracy, we observed that CIPM correctly keeps an aPM up-to-date and estimates performance parameters well so that it supports accurate performance predictions. Regarding the monitoring overhead in our experiments, CIPM’s adaptive instrumentation demonstrated a significant reduction in the number of required instrumentation probes, ranging from 12.6 % to 83.3 %, depending on the specific cases evaluated. Finally, we found out that CIPM’s execution time is reasonable and scales well with an increasing number of model elements and monitoring data.

However, certain changes may inadvertently have a detrimental impact on the overall system performance. To ensure that the performance of new software releases does not degrade, existing practices rely on system-level performance testing, such as load testing, or component-level performance testing to detect performance regressions. However, performance testing for the entire system is often expensive and time-consuming, posing challenges to adapting to the rapid release cycles common in modern DevOps practices. System-level performance testing cannot be conducted until the system is fully built and deployed. On the other hand, component-level testing focuses on isolated components, neglecting overall system performance and the impact of system workloads. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to early detection of performance regressions by bridging the local performance data generated by component-level testing and the system-level architectural models. Our approach uses local performance data to identify deviations at the component level, and then propagate these deviations to the architectural model. We then use the architectural model to predict regressions in the performance of the overall system. We evaluate our approach on two open-source benchmark systems and show that it can effectively detect end-to-end system performance regressions from local performance deviations with different intensities and under various system workloads. More importantly, our approach can detect regressions as early as in the development phase, in contrast to existing approaches that require the system to be fully built and deployed. Our approach is lightweight and can complement traditional system performance testing when testing resources are scarce.","2024-08-15","2025-10-27 09:37:17","2025-10-27 09:37:17","2025-10-21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","Computer Science - Software Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This challenge is exacerbated in the context of a System Under Evaluation (SUE) that operates within a resource-sharing environment, running concurrently with numerous other software components. In this article, we introduce an innovative toolset designed for predicting the performance of such complex and time-critical software systems. Our toolset builds upon the RAST ( R egression A nalysis, S imulation, and load T esting) approach, significantly enhanced in this article compared with its initial version. While current state-of-the-art methods for performance prediction often rely on data collected by Application Performance Monitoring (APM), the unavailability of APM tools for existing systems and the complexities associated with integrating them into legacy software necessitate alternative approaches. Our toolset, therefore, utilizes readily accessible system request logs as a substitute for APM data. We describe the enhancements made to the original RAST approach, we outline the design and implementation of our RAST-based toolset, and we showcase its simulation accuracy and effectiveness using the publicly available TeaStore benchmarking system. To ensure the reproducibility of our experiments, we provide open access to our toolset’s implementation and the utilized TeaStore model.","2025-07-31","2025-10-27 09:37:17","2025-10-27 09:37:17","2025-10-21","1-19","","3","35","","ACM Trans.

While this has improved the reproducibility of benchmarks in the cloud, the complexity of cloud-native environments makes it difficult to run benchmarks reliably. Cloud-native applications are often instrumented or altered at runtime, by dynamically patching or hooking them, which introduces a significant performance overhead. Our work discusses the benchmarking-related pitfalls of the dominant cloud-native technology, Kubernetes, and how they affect performance measurements of dynamically patched or hooked applications. We present recommendations to mitigate these risks and demonstrate how an improper experimental setup can negatively impact latency measurements.","2023-10-19","2025-10-27 09:37:17","2025-10-27 09:37:17","2025-10-21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Performance; Computer Science - Software Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The load variability and interference they experience are generally the main causes of Quality of Service (QoS) degradation, harming depending applications, and resulting in an impaired end-user experience. Uncovering the cause of QoS degradation requires detailed instrumentation of an application's activity. Existing generalisable approaches utilise readily available system metrics that encode interference in kernel metrics, but unfortunately, these approaches lack the required detail to pinpoint granular causes of performance degradation (e.g., lock, disk and CPU contention). In contrast, this paper explores the use of fine-grained system-level metrics to facilitate an application-agnostic diagnosis of QoS degradation. To this end, we introduce and implement $16$ $\textit{eBPF-based metrics}$ spanning over six kernel subsystems, which capture statistics over kernel events that often highlight obstacles impeding an application's progress. We demonstrate the use of our $\textit{eBPF-based metrics}$ through extensive experiments containing a representative set of online data-intensive applications. Results show that the implemented metrics can deconstruct performance degradation when applications face variable workload patterns and common resource contention scenarios, while also revealing applications' internal architecture constraints.","2025-05-19","2025-10-27 09:37:18","2025-10-27 09:37:18","2025-10-21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

State-of-the-art Cloud systems frequently adopt microservices or serverless architectures. Among these, TeaStore is a recognised microservice reference architecture that offers a benchmarking framework for modelling and resource management techniques. However, TeaStore's original configuration lacks the flexibility necessary to address the varied scenarios encountered in real-world applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose an enhanced variant of TeaStore that distinguishes between mandatory and optional services while incorporating third-party service integration. Core services such as WebUI, Image Provider, and Persistence are designated as mandatory to maintain essential functionality, whereas optional services, such as Recommender and Auth, extend the architecture's feature set. We outline the design and configuration possibilities of this adaptable TeaStore variant, aimed at enabling a broader spectrum of configurability and operational resilience.","2024-12-20","2025-10-27 09:37:18","2025-10-27 09:37:18","2025-10-21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Distributed; Parallel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Poll-based Container Monitoring (PCM), the orchestrator periodically checks container health. While a common approach, PCM requires careful tuning, may degrade service availability, and can be slow to detect container health changes. An alternative is Signal-based Container Monitoring (SCM), where the container signals the orchestrator when its status changes. We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of an SCM approach for Kubernetes and empirically show that it has benefits over PCM, as predicted by a new mathematical model. We compare the service availability of SCM and PCM over six experiments using the SockShop benchmark. SCM does not require that polling intervals are tuned, and yet detects container failure 86\% faster than PCM and container readiness in a comparable time with limited resource overheads. We find PCM can erroneously detect failures, and this reduces service availability by 4\%. We propose that orchestrators offer SCM features for faster failure detection than PCM without erroneous detections or careful tuning.","2025-07-02","2025-10-27 09:37:18","2025-10-27 09:37:18","2025-10-21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Distributed; Parallel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While the change of a system‐level configuration would impact lots of jobs in the data centers, traditional load‐testing benchmarks are not sufficient to support the decision‐making because they cannot accurately reproduce the complex behaviors of a large number of jobs. Therefore, we expect to further evaluate the system configuration based on the production environment. However, there are technical challenges, namely, the lack of a holistic evaluation method that can unite the evaluation results of various jobs, and the uninterruptable production environment that should not be affected by the evaluation procedure. To address these challenges, we propose a holistic performance evaluation methodology and design its implementation platform. We introduce a simple but powerful performance metric, ERU (effectiveness of resource usage), and combine the ERU of involved jobs into a summarized value to measure the effect of a configuration change. We validate our ERU metric by comparing it with the CPI (Cycle per Instruction) and QPS (query per second) metrics, deploy the platform to production data centers and demonstrate the effectiveness for measuring system‐level configurations of both software (JVM compiler update) and hardware (NUMA on/off) to save 14.44% and 11% resources respectively in advance.","2022-11-15","2025-10-27 09:37:18","2025-10-27 09:37:18","2025-10-21","e7257","","25","34","","Concurrency and Computation","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the current mainstream system design, the flow control rules are usually fixed and set manually, which cannot be dynamically adjusted according to the flow shape. The performance of the system is thus not fully explored. To mitigate this problem, an adaptive dynamic flow control algorithm is proposed. Based on the system's monitoring data and current flow, the algorithm calculates the flow‐limiting threshold in real time, and then it implements fine‐grained service adaptive flow control to improve the resource utilization. Experimental results show that the performance of the adaptive automatic flow control is better than that of the traditional static method on resource utilization.","2021-09","2025-10-27 09:37:18","2025-10-27 09:37:18","2025-10-21","276-285","","3","3","","Cognitive Comp and Systems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More frequent and intense attacks on cloud and network infrastructures are pushing security systems to the limit. With the end of Moore's Law, merely scaling against these attacks is no longer economically justified. Previous works have already dealt with the adoption of Software-defined Networking and Network Function Virtualization in security systems and used both approaches to optimize performance by the intelligent placement of security functions. However, these works have not yet considered the sequence in which traffic passes through these functions. In this work, we make a case for the need to take this ordering into account by showing its impact. We then propose a reordering framework and analyze what aspects are necessary for modeling security service function chains and making decisions regarding the order based on those models. We show the impact of the order and validate our framework in an evaluation environment. The effect can extend to multiple orders of magnitude, and the framework's evaluation proves the feasibility of our concept.","2020-05-17","2025-10-27 09:37:18","2025-10-27 09:37:18","2025-10-21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","Computer Science - Cryptography and Security; Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Optimal placement of such applications over network nodes is therefore an important issue in integrated Cloud-Fog/Edge computing environments. The service placement problem is challenging due to the complexity of such distributed systems, limited computing resources, placement constraints, global efficiency of the application and quality requirements for end users. This survey attempts to provide a comprehensive and structured presentation of services placement problem research in integrated Cloud-Fog/Edge. We propose a new classification of services placement problem approaches by adopting an algorithmic viewpoint and a breakdown into three categories: graph-based, heuristics and machine-learning approaches. We also provide an analysis and some discussions of the methods, and identify some future challenges and issues in the case of microservices. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the solutions and directions taken by research on this important topic.","2025-11-30","2025-10-27 09:37:18","2025-10-27 09:37:18","2025-10-22 09:17:05","1-36","","11","57","","ACM Comput.

The main objective of this approach is to provide optimal personalized services as fast as possible. Indeed, a new ontology for semantic description and parallel management of the contextual services is presented. At first, a new dominance operator‐based constraints violation degree is used to reduce the search space. Then, optimal personalized paths that meet user's needs, preferences and devices' availability are discovered and selected in a smaller search space more effectively and efficiently using dynamic services selection algorithm, based on new ASSACR multiagent strategies. To validate the performance and efficiency of the proposed approach, we compared the proposed approach with existing multiagent strategies of the diabetic follow‐up use cases. Experimental results show that the proposed approach effectively addressed both the semantic service representation and agent aspects in terms of performance and quality service selection.","2022-02-28","2025-10-27 09:37:18","2025-10-27 09:37:18","2025-10-22 09:18:46","e6697","","5","34","","Concurrency and Computation","A decentralized","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we present a systematic review of various Kubernetes scheduling strategies, categorizing them into hardware-centric and software-centric, annotating each with its sustainability objectives, and grouping them according to the algorithms they use. We propose a comprehensive taxonomy for cloud task scheduling studies, with a particular focus on the environmental sustainability aspect.

Recent advancements in AI, particularly deep learning and large language models (LLMs), have dramatically enhanced the capabilities of these distributed systems, yet introduce significant challenges in model deployment and resource management. In this survey, we comprehensive examine the intersection of distributed intelligence and model optimization within edge-cloud environments, providing a structured tutorial on fundamental architectures, enabling technologies, and emerging applications. Additionally, we systematically analyze model optimization approaches, including compression, adaptation, and neural architecture search, alongside AI-driven resource management strategies that balance performance, energy efficiency, and latency requirements. We further explore critical aspects of privacy protection and security enhancement within ECCC systems and examines practical deployments through diverse applications, spanning autonomous driving, healthcare, and industrial automation. Performance analysis and benchmarking techniques are also thoroughly explored to establish evaluation standards for these complex systems. Furthermore, the review identifies critical research directions including LLMs deployment, 6G integration, neuromorphic computing, and quantum computing, offering a roadmap for addressing persistent challenges in heterogeneity management, real-time processing, and scalability. By bridging theoretical advancements and practical deployments, this survey offers researchers and practitioners a holistic perspective on leveraging AI to optimize distributed computing environments, fostering innovation in next-generation intelligent systems.","2025-08-21","2025-10-27 09:37:18","2025-10-27 09:37:18","2025-10-22 09:22:44","","","","","","","Edge-Cloud Collaborative Computing on Distributed Intelligence and Model Optimization","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms effectively help designers identify trade-offs among the desired non-functional properties. To reduce the use of computational resources, this work examines the impact of implementing a search budget to limit the search for design alternatives. In particular, we analyze how time budgets affect the quality of Pareto fronts by utilizing quality indicators and exploring the structural features of the generated design alternatives. This study identifies distinct behavioral differences among evolutionary algorithms when a search budget is implemented. It further reveals that design alternatives generated under a budget are structurally different from those produced without one. Additionally, we offer recommendations for designers on selecting algorithms in relation to time constraints, thereby facilitating the effective application of automated refactoring to improve non-functional properties.","2026-06","2025-10-27 09:37:18","2025-10-27 09:37:18","2025-10-22 09:22:48","18","","1","33","","Autom Softw Eng","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

New methods are needed to mitigate this consumption, e.g.  energy-aware workload scheduling, improved usage of renewable energy sources, etc.  These schemes need to understand the interaction between energy considerations and Cloud–Edge components.  Model-based approaches are an effective way to do this; however, current theoretical Cloud–Edge models are limited, and few consider energy factors.  This paper analyses all relevant models proposed between 2016 and 2023, discovers key omissions, and identifies the major energy considerations that need to be addressed for Green Cloud–Edge systems (including interaction with energy providers).

This paper proposes a method to model and optimize reliability for microservice‐based cloud applications using multi‐agent system (MAS), thus maximizing the reliability of cloud computing and dynamically scheduling microservices to minimize the delay within the budget. Firstly, a dynamic microservice scheduling scheme is proposed to provide efficient computing services by using MAS. A hierarchical cloud computing model is formed by predicated Petri net (PrT net) and the properties of constructed model are analysed. Secondly, agents have been utilized to describe the essential characteristics of microservice scheduling process in the cloud applications. The partial critical path (PCP) aims to maximize the reliability of cloud applications under the limitation of budget and meet the user‐defined deadline. Finally, the proposed PCPRO algorithm has been applied to cloud environment, which is suitable for different scientific workflows in the cloud computing environment. The effectiveness of this method is verified by simulation, the experiment results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","2022-06","2025-10-27 09:37:19","2025-10-27 09:37:19","2025-10-22 09:28:24","1182-1199","","10","16","","IET Communications","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In dense areas with many active RAN nodes, compute resources are engineered to support potentially hundreds of xApps monitoring and controlling the RAN to achieve operator's intents. However, such resources might become underutilized during low-traffic periods, where most cells are sleeping and, given the reduced RAN complexity, only a few xApps are needed for its control. In this paper, we propose CORMO-RAN, a data-driven orchestrator that dynamically activates compute nodes based on xApp load to save energy, and performs lossless migration of xApps from nodes to be turned off to active ones while ensuring xApp availability during migration. CORMO-RAN tackles the trade-off among service availability, scalability, and energy consumption while (i) preserving xApps' internal state to prevent RAN performance degradation during migration; (ii) accounting for xApp diversity in state size and timing constraints; and (iii) implementing several migration strategies and providing guidelines on best strategies to use based on resource availability and requirements. We prototype CORMO-RAN as an rApp, and experimentally evaluate it on an O-RAN private 5G testbed hosted on a Red Hat OpenShift cluster with commercial radio units. Results demonstrate that CORMO-RAN is effective in minimizing energy consumption of the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) cluster, yielding up to 64% energy saving when compared to existing approaches.","2025-06-24","2025-10-27 09:37:19","2025-10-27 09:37:19","2025-10-22 09:29:10","","","","","","","CORMO-RAN","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When multiple versions (or “ flavours ”) of a component are available, application managers must select a flavour for each deployed component, and assign these components to specific nodes, all while considering constraints such as dependencies, quality of service (QoS), budget, operational costs, and carbon emissions. In complex scenarios, finding the optimal deployment is often infeasible for human operators without automated tools to systematically explore the solution space. To address this challenge, we introduce FREEDA, a first constraint optimisation approach for deploying constrained and multi-flavoured applications on Cloud-Edge infrastructure topologies. We demonstrate the practical feasibility of FREEDA through experiments on a variety of realistic Cloud-Edge infrastructural topologies and component architectures. Furthermore, we benchmark FREEDA against Zephyrus, a comparable tool employing the same underlying solving technology. Empirical results show that FREEDA achieves strong scalability across a broad spectrum of realistic configurations and consistently outperforms Zephyrus.","2025-07-30","2025-10-27 09:37:19","2025-10-27 09:37:19","2025-10-22 09:29:38","3757061","","","","","ACM Trans.

So far, most carbon-aware strategies have focused on leveraging the flexibility of scheduling decisions for batch processing by shifting the time and location of workload executions. However, such approaches cannot be applied to service-oriented cloud applications, since they have to be reachable at every point in time and often at low latencies. We propose a carbon-aware approach for operating microservices under hourly carbon budgets. By choosing the most appropriate version and horizontal scaleout for each microservice, our strategy maximizes user experience and revenue while staying within budget constraints. Experiments across various application configurations and carbon budgets demonstrate that the approach adapts properly to changing workloads and carbon intensities.","2025-06-26","2025-10-27 09:37:19","2025-10-27 09:37:19","2025-10-22 09:29:50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Distributed; Parallel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

New methods are needed to mitigate this consumption, e.g.  energy-aware workload scheduling, improved usage of renewable energy sources, etc.  These schemes need to understand the interaction between energy considerations and Cloud–Edge components.  Model-based approaches are an effective way to do this; however, current theoretical Cloud–Edge models are limited, and few consider energy factors.  This paper analyses all relevant models proposed between 2016 and 2023, discovers key omissions, and identifies the major energy considerations that need to be addressed for Green Cloud–Edge systems (including interaction with energy providers).

This paper proposes a method to model and optimize reliability for microservice‐based cloud applications using multi‐agent system (MAS), thus maximizing the reliability of cloud computing and dynamically scheduling microservices to minimize the delay within the budget. Firstly, a dynamic microservice scheduling scheme is proposed to provide efficient computing services by using MAS. A hierarchical cloud computing model is formed by predicated Petri net (PrT net) and the properties of constructed model are analysed. Secondly, agents have been utilized to describe the essential characteristics of microservice scheduling process in the cloud applications. The partial critical path (PCP) aims to maximize the reliability of cloud applications under the limitation of budget and meet the user‐defined deadline. Finally, the proposed PCPRO algorithm has been applied to cloud environment, which is suitable for different scientific workflows in the cloud computing environment. The effectiveness of this method is verified by simulation, the experiment results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","2022-06","2025-10-27 09:37:19","2025-10-27 09:37:19","2025-10-22 09:31:00","1182-1199","","10","16","","IET Communications","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This survey attempts to provide a comprehensive and structured presentation of services placement problem research in integrated Cloud-Fog/Edge. We propose a new classification of services placement problem approaches by adopting an algorithmic viewpoint and a breakdown into three categories: graph-based, heuristics and machine-learning approaches.

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of existing approaches to make edge computing networks greener, including but not limited to the exploitation of renewable energy resources, and context-awareness. We hence provide an updated account of recent developments on MEC from an energetic sustainability perspective, addressing the initial deployment of computing resources, their dynamic (re)allocation, as well as distributed and federated learning designs. In doing so, we highlight the energy aspects of these algorithms, advocating the need for energy-sustainable edge computing systems that are aligned with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris agreement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work providing a systematic literature review on the efficient deployment and management of energy harvesting MEC, with special focus on the deployment, provisioning, and scheduling of computing tasks, including federated learning for distributed edge intelligence, toward making edge networks greener and more sustainable.

When multiple versions (or “ flavours ”) of a component are available, application managers must select a flavour for each deployed component, and assign these components to specific nodes, all while considering constraints such as dependencies, quality of service (QoS), budget, operational costs, and carbon emissions. In complex scenarios, finding the optimal deployment is often infeasible for human operators without automated tools to systematically explore the solution space. To address this challenge, we introduce FREEDA, a first constraint optimisation approach for deploying constrained and multi-flavoured applications on Cloud-Edge infrastructure topologies. We demonstrate the practical feasibility of FREEDA through experiments on a variety of realistic Cloud-Edge infrastructural topologies and component architectures. Furthermore, we benchmark FREEDA against Zephyrus, a comparable tool employing the same underlying solving technology. Empirical results show that FREEDA achieves strong scalability across a broad spectrum of realistic configurations and consistently outperforms Zephyrus.","2025-07-30","2025-10-27 09:37:19","2025-10-27 09:37:19","2025-10-22 09:32:03","3757061","","","","","ACM Trans.

However, operating a large-scale EC network would inevitably result in a significant energy cost for EC providers, potentially offsetting their service revenue without proper energy cost management. In this paper, we focus on conserving energy cost for EC providers by leveraging both electricity price-aware geographical load balancing and dynamic central processing unit (CPU) provisioning, considering the spatio-temporal diversities of electricity prices and user task demands. Due to the significant “switching cost” associated with turning CPUs and services on/off, we formulate a multi-timescale energy cost minimization problem that integrates large-timescale CPU provisioning and service placement, as well as small-timescale geographical task dispatching and CPU resource allocation. The Lagrange dual decomposition theory is exploited to handle the spatio-temporal variable couplings. A fully distributed mini-batch learning (MBL) algorithm that relies on parameter approximation for large-timescale decision makings is proposed to learn the optimal dual variables, i.e., the Lagrange multipliers. We present rigorous algorithm performance analysis, and conduct extensive simulations based on real data of electricity prices of Canada to demonstrate the superior performance of the MBL algorithm compared to several baseline schemes.</p>","2023-07-10","2025-10-27 09:37:19","2025-10-27 09:37:19","2025-10-22 09:32:42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article investigates the problem of reliable resource provisioning in joint edge-cloud environments, and surveys technologies, mechanisms, and methods that can be used to improve the reliability of distributed applications in diverse and heterogeneous network environments. Due to the complexity of the problem, special emphasis is placed on solutions to the characterization, management, and control of complex distributed applications using machine learning approaches. The survey is structured around a decomposition of the reliable resource provisioning problem into three categories of techniques: workload characterization and prediction, component placement and system consolidation, and application elasticity and remediation.

However, cloud computing systems continue to face problems such as hardware failures, overloads caused by unexpected workloads, or the waste of energy due to inefficient resource utilization, which all result in resource shortages and application issues such as delays or saturation. A paradigm, the brownout, has been applied to handle these issues by adaptively activating or deactivating optional parts of applications or services to manage resource usage in cloud computing system. Brownout has successfully shown that it can avoid overloads due to changes in workload and achieve better load balancing and energy saving effects.

The importance of maintaining quality of service in accordance with customer expectations and the highly dynamic nature of cloud-hosted applications add new levels of complexity to the process. Advances in big-data learning approaches have shifted conventional static capacity planning solutions to complex performance-aware resource management methods. It is shown that the process of decision-making for resource adjustment is closely related to the behavior of the system, including the utilization of resources and application components. Therefore, a continuous monitoring of system attributes and performance metrics provides the raw data for the analysis of problems affecting the performance of the application. Data analytic methods, such as statistical and machine-learning approaches, offer the required concepts, models, and tools to dig into the data and find general rules, patterns, and characteristics that define the functionality of the system. Obtained knowledge from the data analysis process helps to determine the changes in the workloads, faulty components, or problems that can cause system performance to degrade. A timely reaction to performance degradation can avoid violations of service level agreements, including performing proper corrective actions such as auto-scaling or other resource adjustment solutions. In this article, we investigate the main requirements and limitations of cloud resource management, including a study of the approaches to workload and anomaly analysis in the context of performance management in the cloud. A taxonomy of the works on this problem is presented that identifies main approaches in existing research from the data analysis side to resource adjustment techniques. Finally, considering the observed gaps in the general direction of the reviewed works, a list of these gaps is proposed for future researchers to pursue.","2020-07-31","2025-10-27 09:37:19","2025-10-27 09:37:19","2025-10-22 09:33:49","1-37","","4","52","","ACM Comput.

However the continuous emergence of new applications such as the Internet of Things (IoTs) with thousands of users put a significant load on cloud infrastructure. Load balancing of resource allocation in cloud-oriented IoT is a critical factor that has a significant impact on the smooth operation of cloud services and customer satisfaction. Several load balancing strategies for cloud environment have been proposed in the past. However the existing approaches mostly consider only a few parameters and ignore many critical factors having a pivotal role in load balancing leading to less optimized resource allocation. Load balancing is a challenging problem and therefore the research community has recently focused towards employing machine learning-based metaheuristic approaches for load balancing in the cloud. In this paper we propose a metaheuristics-based scheme Data Format Classification using Support Vector Machine (DFC-SVM), to deal with the load balancing problem. The proposed scheme aims to reduce the online load balancing complexity by offline-based pre-classification of raw-data from diverse sources (such as IoT) into different formats e.g. text images media etc. SVM is utilized to classify “n” types of data formats featuring audio video text digital images and maps etc. A one-to-many classification approach has been developed so that data formats from the cloud are initially classified into their respective classes and assigned to virtual machines through the proposed modified version of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) which schedules the data of a particular class efficiently. The experimental results compared with the baselines have shown a significant improvement in the performance of the proposed approach. Overall an average of 94% classification accuracy is achieved along with 11.82% less energy 16% less response time and 16.08% fewer SLA violations are observed.","2022-02-28","2025-10-27 09:37:19","2025-10-27 09:37:19","2025-10-22 09:34:49","1-35","","1","22","","ACM Trans.

In this work, a multi-cloud environment is modeled as geographically distributed data centers with varying solar power generation corresponding to its location, electricity price, carbon emission, and carbon tax. The energy management of the workload allocation algorithm is strongly dependent on the nature of the application considered.

Load balancing and energy consumption are two core performance parameters in the computational grid. Since, performance of a computational grid is highly dependable to variations in load and energy consumption, therefore, it is important to pay attention to these aspects in grid. Therefore, we proposed an energy‐aware dynamic load balancing strategy for tasks scheduling in grid referred to as dynamic energy efficient load balancing strategy (DEEL) for computational grid . DEEL combined energy efficiency and load balancing paradigms in order to improve the utilization and reduce the energy consumption of resources. Simulations were performed by using GridSim. Simulation results were compared with published strategy IEGDC with respect to performance indices: finished gridlets, unfinished gridlets, resubmitted times, and response time. The simulation results were evaluated through performance metrics that is, (a) cost, (b) energy consumption, and (c) energy saved. As per simulation results, DEEL outperformed the published method IEGDC by reducing the execution time of finished gridlets up to 28%, minimizing the execution and resource cost up to 35%, and saving the energy consumption up to 38%.","2022-01-10","2025-10-27 09:37:19","2025-10-27 09:37:19","2025-10-22 09:35:25","e6484","","1","34","","Concurrency and Computation","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With cloud data centers' carbon footprint rising sharply, understanding and minimizing the carbon impact of serverless functions becomes crucial. The unique characteristics of serverless functions, such as event-driven invocation, pay-as-you-go billing model, short execution duration, ephemeral runtime, and opaque underlying infrastructure, pose challenges in effective carbon metering. In this paper, we argue that the current carbon estimation methodologies should be expanded for more accurate carbon accounting in serverless settings, and propose a usage and allocation-based carbon model that aligns with the context of serverless computing. We also articulate how current serverless systems and billing models do not make it financially attractive to prioritize sustainability for a broad class of users and developers. To solve this, we propose a new carbon-aware pricing model and evaluate its ability to incentivize sustainable practices for developers through better alignment of billing and carbon efficiency.","2024-12","2025-10-27 09:37:20","2025-10-27 09:37:20","2025-10-22 09:40:56","120-126","","5","4","","SIGENERGY Energy Inform.

In principle, the function as a service (FaaS) paradigm should simplify such optimizations by abstracting away compute location, but existing FaaS systems do not provide for user transparency over application energy consumption or task placement. Here we present GreenFaaS, a novel open source framework that bridges this gap between energy-efficient applications and FaaS platforms. GreenFaaS can be deployed by end users or providers across systems to monitor energy use, provide task-specific feedback, and schedule tasks in an energy-aware manner. We demonstrate that intelligent placement of tasks can both reduce energy consumption and improve performance. For a synthetic workload, GreenFaaS reduces the energy-delay product by 45% compared to alternatives. Furthermore, running a molecular design application through GreenFaaS can reduce energy consumption by 21% and runtime by 63% by better matching tasks with machines.","2024-06-25","2025-10-27 09:37:20","2025-10-27 09:37:20","2025-10-22 09:40:58","","","","","","","GreenFaaS","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Distributed; Parallel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, while cost may motivate efficiency improvements by infrastructure operators, broader progress is impeded by a lack of user incentives. We conduct a survey of HPC users that reveals fewer than 30 percent are aware of their energy consumption, and that energy efficiency is among users' lowest priority concerns. One explanation is that existing pricing models may encourage users to prioritize performance over energy efficiency. We propose two transparent multi-resource pricing schemes, Energy- and Carbon-Based Accounting, that seek to change this paradigm by incentivizing more efficient user behavior. These two schemes charge for computations based on their energy consumption or carbon footprint, respectively, rewarding users who leverage efficient hardware and software. We evaluate these two pricing schemes via simulation, in a prototype, and a user study.","2025-01-16","2025-10-27 09:37:20","2025-10-27 09:37:20","2025-10-22 09:41:10","","","","","","","Core Hours and Carbon Credits","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Distributed; Parallel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we propose a decentralized microservice architecture (DMSA), which delegates scheduling functions from the control plane to edge nodes. DMSA redesigns and implements three core modules of microservice discovery, monitoring, and scheduling for edge networks to achieve precise awareness of instance deployments, low monitoring overhead and measurement errors, and accurate dynamic scheduling, respectively. Particularly, DMSA has customized a microservice scheduling scheme that leverages multi-port listening and zero-copy forwarding to guarantee high data forwarding efficiency. Moreover, a dynamic weighted multi-level load balancing algorithm is proposed to adjust scheduling dynamically with consideration of reliability, priority, and response delay. Finally, we have implemented a physical verification platform for DMSA. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art and traditional scheduling schemes, DMSA effectively counteracts link failures and network fluctuations, improving the service response delay and execution success rate by approximately $60\% \sim 75\%$ and $10\%\sim15\%$, respectively.","2025-01-01","2025-10-27 09:37:20","2025-10-27 09:37:20","2025-10-22 09:50:21","","","","","","","DMSA","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","Computer Science - Hardware Architecture; Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, it is important to properly account for the power consumed by each of the running applications, which are packaged as containers. This paper examines multiple challenges associated with this goal. The first challenge is that multiple customers are sharing the same hardware platform (multi-tenancy), where information on the physical servers is mostly obscured. The second challenge is the overhead in power consumption that the Cloud platform control plane induces. This paper addresses these challenges and introduces a novel pipeline framework for power model training. This allows versatile power consumption approximation of individual containers on the basis of available performance counters and other metrics. The proposed model utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the power consumed by the control plane and associated processes, and uses it for isolating the power consumed by the user containers, from the server power consumption. To determine how well the prediction results in an isolation, we introduce a metric termed isolation goodness. Applying the proposed power model does not require online power measurements, nor does it need information on the physical servers, configuration, or information on other tenants sharing the same machine. The results of cross-workload, cross-platform experiments demonstrated the higher accuracy of the proposed model when predicting power consumption of unseen containers on unknown platforms, including on virtual machines.","2024-04-10","2025-10-27 09:37:20","2025-10-27 09:37:20","2025-10-22 09:51:28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since 2014, when Martin Fowler popularized the Microservice term, many studies have been published relating these subjects to explore how the Edge's low-latency feature could be combined with the high throughput of the distributed paradigm from Microservices. Objective: Identifying how Microservices work together with Edge Computing whereas they take advantage when running on Edge. Method: In order to better understand this relationship, we first identified its key concepts, which are: architecture approaches and features, microservice composition (orchestration/choreography), and offloading. Afterward, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) as the survey method. Results: We reviewed 111 selected studies and built a taxonomy of Microservices on Edge Computing demonstrating their current architecture approaches and features, composition, and offloading modes. Moreover, we identify the research gaps and trends. Conclusion: This paper is a step forward to help researchers and professionals get a general overview of how Microservices and Edge have been related in the last years. It also discusses gaps and research trends. This SLR will also be a good introduction for new researchers in Edge and Microservices.","2023-01-23","2025-10-27 09:37:20","2025-10-27 09:37:20","2025-10-22 09:54:05","","","","","","","Relating Edge Computing and Microservices by means of Architecture Approaches and Features, Orchestration, Choreography, and Offloading","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Distributed; Parallel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Microservice technology is also adopted in these scenarios to decompose complex business logic into many small independent services. Meanwhile, as microservice systems continue to grow, providing stable QoS in these systems becomes a challenge, and many different approaches have been proposed for stable QoS. However, the microservice systems used in the experiments of these work have problems such as the low number of services and a single type of service. Therefore, we developed the open-source benchmark microservice system RescureService with 20+ services, including database, front-end, business logic, data processing, and artificial intelligence services in the disaster relief scenario. Measuring tools are provided to measure the service properties to help researchers prepare experimental data, and the service properties pre-measured are also presented. Meanwhile, the fulfillment of benchmark requirements is detailed, and the results show that our RescureService meets the requirements of a benchmark system in research. Moreover, instructions are given to describe adopting our system in service computing as examples.","2022-10-28","2025-10-27 09:37:20","2025-10-27 09:37:20","2025-10-22 09:54:11","","","","","","","RescureService","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Distributed; Parallel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Runtime adaptations-in response to varying load, QoS fulfillment, mobility, etc.-are typically based on coarse-grained and costly management operations such as resource re-allocation or migration. The services themselves, however, remain non-adaptive, worsening the already limited elasticity of Edge Computing compared to Cloud Computing. Edge computing applications often have stringent requirements on the execution time but are flexible regarding the quality of a computation. The potential benefits of exploiting this trade-off remain untapped. This paper introduces the concept of adaptable microservices that provide alternative variants of specific functionalities. We define so-called service variants that differ w.r.t. the internal functioning of the service, manifested in different algorithms, parameters, and auxiliary data they use. Such variants allow fine-grained trade-offs between the QoS (e.g., a maximum tolerable execution time) and the quality of the computation. We integrate adaptable microservices into an Edge Computing framework, show the practical impact of service variants, and present a strategy for switching variants at runtime.","2021-05-19","2025-10-27 09:37:20","2025-10-27 09:37:20","2025-10-22 09:54:15","","","","","","","Chameleons on Cloudlets","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Architectural perspectives-an architectural knowledge artifact composed of concerns, activities, tactics, pitfalls, and checklists-offer a promising approach to tackle such emerging quality properties across architectural views and are also independent of architecture frameworks and industry contexts. In this paper, we present a sustainability perspective vision, i.e., a revised notion of architectural perspective meant to be filled with its own elements to target sustainability concerns. We formulate our sustainability perspective vision through evidence from applying snowballing to seminal literature and from conducting a focus group with experts in the field. Our findings confirm the relevance of the different perspective elements in practice and highlight implications for shaping a sustainability perspective that meets industrial needs.","2025-08-28","2025-10-27 09:37:20","2025-10-27 09:37:20","2025-10-22 09:56:11","","","","","","","Towards an Architectural Perspective for Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","Computer Science - Software Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditionally, the configurations of these workflows are optimized to achieve a short runtime for the given task and dataset on a given (often distributed) infrastructure. However, recently more attention has been drawn to energy-efficient computing, due to the negative impact of energy-inefficient computing on the environment and energy costs. To be able to assess the energy-efficiency of a given workflow configuration, reliable and accurate methods to measure the energy consumption of a system are required. One approach is the usage of built-in hardware energy counters, such as Intel RAPL. Unfortunately, effectively using RAPL for energy measurement within a workflow on a managed cluster with the typical deep software infrastructure stack can be difficult, for instance because of limited privileges and the need for communication between nodes. In this paper, we describe three ways to implement RAPL energy measurement on a Kubernetes cluster while executing scientific workflows utilizing the Nextflow workflow engine. We compare them by utilizing a set of eight criteria that should be fulfilled for accurate measurement, such as the ability to react to workflow faults, portability, and added overhead. We highlight advantages and drawbacks of each method and discuss challenges and pitfalls, as well as ways to avoid them. We also empirically evaluate all methods, and find that approaches using a shell script and a Nextflow plugin are both effective and easy to implement. Additionally, we find that measuring the energy consumption of a single task is straight forward when only one task runs at a time, but concurrent task executions on the same node require approximating per-task energy usage using metrics such as CPU utilization.","2025-05-19","2025-10-27 09:37:20","2025-10-27 09:37:20","2025-10-22 15:15:33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Distributed; Parallel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this shift has also led to increased demand for cloud resources, contributing to higher energy consumption and carbon emissions. While existing research has focused on measuring fine-grained energy usage of CPU and memory at the container level, or on system-wide assessments, these approaches often overlook the energy impact of cross-container service interactions, especially those involving network and storage for auxiliary services such as observability and system monitoring. To address this gap, we introduce a service-level energy model that captures the distributed nature of microservice execution across containers. Our model is supported by an experimentation tool that accounts for energy consumption not just in CPU and memory, but also in network and storage components. We validate our approach through extensive experimentation with diverse experiment configurations of auxiliary services for a popular open-source cloud-native microservice application. Results show that omitting network and storage can lead to an underestimation of auxiliary service energy use by up to 63%, highlighting the need for more comprehensive energy assessments in the design of energy-efficient microservice architectures.","2025-10-15","2025-10-27 09:37:20","2025-10-27 09:37:20","2025-10-22 15:15:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Distributed; Parallel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As such, optimizing the energy efficiency of Kubernetes-deployed workloads is of primary interest towards controlling operational expenses by reducing energy consumption at data center level and allocated resources at application level. A lot of research in this direction aims on reducing the total energy usage of Kubernetes clusters without establishing an understanding of their workloads, i.e. the applications deployed on the cluster. This means that there are untapped potential improvements in energy efficiency that can be achieved through, for example, application refactoring or deployment optimization. For all these cases a prerequisite is establishing fine-grained observability down to the level of individual containers and their power draw over time. A state-of-the-art tool approved by the Cloud-Native Computing Foundation, Kepler, aims to provide this functionality, but has not been assessed for its accuracy and therefore fitness for purpose. In this work we start by developing an experimental procedure to this goal, and we conclude that the reported energy usage metrics provided by Kepler are not at a satisfactory level. As a reaction to this, we develop KubeWatt as an alternative to Kepler for specific use case scenarios, and demonstrate its higher accuracy through the same experimental procedure as we used for Kepler.","2025-04-14","2025-10-27 09:37:20","2025-10-27 09:37:20","2025-10-22 15:15:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Software Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

VNF‐based IoT MEC systems encounter a significant security threat due to unauthorized access, posing risks to data privacy and system integrity. Existing approaches struggle to adapt to dynamic environments and lack tamper‐proof enforcement mechanisms. In this work, we propose a novel system combining Reinforcement Learning (RL) and blockchain technology to revoke unauthorized access in VNF‐based IoT MEC. We introduce the Integrated Action‐selection DRL Algorithm for Unauthorized Access Revocation (IASDRL‐UAR), a novel RL approach that excels in dynamic environments by handling both continuous and discrete actions, enabling real‐time optimization of security risk, execution time, and energy consumption. A behavior control contract (BCC) is proposed and integrated into the RL system, automating behavior checks and enforcement, streamlining security management, and reducing manual intervention. RL feedback plays a pivotal role in steering dynamic security adjustments, gaining valuable perspectives from user behavior via trust scores in the behavior contract. The security features of the proposed method are analyzed. Performance comparisons reveal a substantial improvement, with the proposed system outperforming existing methods by 30% in terms of throughput, 21.7% in system stability, and 26% in access revocation latency. Additionally, the system demonstrates a higher security index, energy efficiency, and scalability.","2024-05","2025-10-27 09:37:20","2025-10-27 09:37:20","2025-10-22 15:17:58","e4981","","5","35","","Trans Emerging Tel Tech","Reinforcement learning based blockchain model for revoking unauthorized access in","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To handle this big data, researchers have proposed hybrid model SDP (Serverless data pipeline) approaches, supporting intermediate data processing across the fog topology. However, these predetermined path SDPs never consider the task expectation requirements and current node capabilities, and data flows through fixed paths. But in shared network environments like fog and cloud, we cannot expect that the resources will always be reserved for the pipeline. This predetermined SDP's behavior ultimately produces a low Quality of Experience (QoE) for the user regarding pipeline performance. This paper proposes a QoE‐based dynamic path SDP, which can dynamically reroute its data path on the nodes and offer better QoE. For the node selection, we used the hierarchical fuzzy‐based placement strategy and demonstrated the approach with an SDP image processing application. The designed QoE‐based SDP outperforms the Predetermined SDP in handling real‐time data without any pipeline interrupts. The experiment results showed that the proposed method is almost free from the bottleneck effect with a loss of 2% packet drops. In Predetermined SDP, we found 74% of packet loss when the load on the SDP is significant.","2025-09-15","2025-10-27 09:37:21","2025-10-27 09:37:21","2025-10-22 15:18:40","spe.70018","","","","","Softw Pract Exp","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Different from monolithic design, microservice enjoys merits of fine‐grained and loosely coupled services, and it is becoming more and more popular. The application developed with microservice has a good advantage in independent development and flexible deployment, especially for complex distributed systems. However, there is a big gap between the reliability requirements and microservice‐based cloud applications. This article proposes a reliability model of microservice‐based cloud application by using predicate Petri net. First, a microservice reliability requirement is given, some basic concepts of predicate Petri net are defined with syntax and semantics. Second, a microservice reliability strategy is proposed, which uses microservice instances and circuit breaker to improve the reliability of the system. Based on the constructed microservice reliability model, the correctness of predicate Petri net modelling and the effectiveness of the strategies are proven theoretically. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the establishment and analysis process of the model, and several groups of experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the method. Experimental results show that the proposed microservice reliability strategy is effective.","2022-07","2025-10-27 09:37:21","2025-10-27 09:37:21","2025-10-22 15:18:50","e12924","","6","39","","Expert Systems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Optimal placement of such applications over network nodes is therefore an important issue in integrated Cloud-Fog/Edge computing environments. The service placement problem is challenging due to the complexity of such distributed systems, limited computing resources, placement constraints, global efficiency of the application and quality requirements for end users. This survey attempts to provide a comprehensive and structured presentation of services placement problem research in integrated Cloud-Fog/Edge. We propose a new classification of services placement problem approaches by adopting an algorithmic viewpoint and a breakdown into three categories: graph-based, heuristics and machine-learning approaches. We also provide an analysis and some discussions of the methods, and identify some future challenges and issues in the case of microservices. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the solutions and directions taken by research on this important topic.","2025-11-30","2025-10-27 09:37:21","2025-10-27 09:37:21","2025-10-22 15:21:17","1-36","","11","57","","ACM Comput.

However, existing performance models of such systems fall short in providing comprehensive insights into the intricate interplay between data placement and data processing. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel class of performance models that enables joint analysis of data storage access workflows, caching, and queueing contention. Our proposed models introduce a notion of access path for data items to model hierarchical data locality constraints. We develop analytical solutions to efficiently approximate the performance metrics of these models under different data caching policies, finding in particular conditions under which the underlying Markov chain admits a product-form solution. Extensive trace-driven simulations based on real-world datasets indicate that service and data placement policies based on our proposed models can respectively improve by up to 35% and 37% the average response time in edge and data mesh case studies.","2024-12-31","2025-10-27 09:37:21","2025-10-27 09:37:21","2025-10-22 15:22:19","1-30","","4","9","","ACM Trans.

The benchmarks focusing on individual microservice components are insufficient because the reference relationships between components, which form the microservice workflow structure, are another critical aspect of microservice applications. Unfortunately, understanding the characteristics of microservice workflow in the production Cloud remains a missing piece in the literature, which prevents the representative of microservice benchmarks. In this paper, we fill this gap by characterizing and synthesizing the microservice workflows based on the trace data of the Toutiao application that is running on ByteDance Cloud. We examine the microservice workflows starting from DAG graphs, introduce observed properties that are easy to ignore but important, show the artificiality of the workflow by statistic description, and explore the high cost of network overhead. We further synthesize the workflow following the characteristics observed. The extensive evaluations show that the synthesized microservice workflows have consistent statistical characteristics as the production ones. A case study applying the synthesized workflows proves its usability.","2022-08","2025-10-27 09:37:21","2025-10-27 09:37:21","2025-10-22 15:22:31","e2467","","8","34","","J Software Evolu Process","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, the cloud-edge collaborative environment introduces more difficulties, such as unstable networks and high latency across network segments. Accurately identifying the root cause of microservices in a cloud-edge collaborative environment has thus become an urgent problem. In this paper, we propose MicroCERCL, a novel approach that pinpoints root causes at the kernel and application level in the cloud-edge collaborative environment. Our key insight is that failures propagate through direct invocations and indirect resource-competition dependencies in a cloud-edge collaborative environment characterized by instability and high latency. This will become more complex in the hybrid deployment that simultaneously involves multiple microservice systems. Leveraging this insight, we extract valid contents from kernel-level logs to prioritize localizing the kernel-level root cause. Moreover, we construct a heterogeneous dynamic topology stack and train a graph neural network model to accurately localize the application-level root cause without relying on historical data. Notably, we released the first benchmark hybrid deployment microservice system in a cloud-edge collaborative environment (the largest and most complex within our knowledge). Experiments conducted on the dataset collected from the benchmark show that MicroCERCL can accurately localize the root cause of microservice systems in such environments, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches with an increase of at least 24.1% in top-1 accuracy.","2024-06-19","2025-10-27 09:37:21","2025-10-27 09:37:21","2025-10-22 15:22:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Performance; Computer Science - Software Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

IoT applications are highly sensitive to latency, making it crucial to place microservices on appropriate edge servers in an edge computing environment. Failure to do so can significantly impact service quality and degrade user experience, posing a major challenge. Addressing the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a multiobjective service deployment strategy for IoT devices based on reinforcement learning. The goal is to minimize service access delay for IoT devices and reduce the average energy consumption of edge servers in the context of mobile edge computing. To achieve this, we first establish a stochastic optimization model using the Markov decision process (MDP) framework to handle service deployment and resource allocation dynamically. This model captures key characteristics such as heterogeneity in edge server capabilities, dynamic geographic information of IoT devices, and uncertainty in microservice requests. To overcome challenges related to dimensionality, slow convergence, and the exploration–exploitation tradeoff in traditional reinforcement learning algorithms, we introduce deep reinforcement learning into the optimization of microservice deployment. Specifically, we propose the use of deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) to obtain a near‐optimal service deployment strategy without manual instructions. DDPG leverages the depth of the network to guide policy gradients and generate solutions that effectively balance exploration and exploitation. To evaluate the proposed approach, we implement the DPG‐MSP ( DDPG ‐based M icro S ervice P lacement) algorithm using real datasets and synthetic data. Comparative analysis with existing microservice deployment algorithms demonstrates the superiority of DDPG‐MSP in terms of performance, robustness, and scalability.","2025-07-25","2025-10-27 09:37:21","2025-10-27 09:37:21","2025-10-22 15:23:18","e70154","","15-17","37","","Concurrency and Computation","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Microservice technology is also adopted in these scenarios to decompose complex business logic into many small independent services. Meanwhile, as microservice systems continue to grow, providing stable QoS in these systems becomes a challenge, and many different approaches have been proposed for stable QoS. However, the microservice systems used in the experiments of these work have problems such as the low number of services and a single type of service. Therefore, we developed the open-source benchmark microservice system RescureService with 20+ services, including database, front-end, business logic, data processing, and artificial intelligence services in the disaster relief scenario. Measuring tools are provided to measure the service properties to help researchers prepare experimental data, and the service properties pre-measured are also presented. Meanwhile, the fulfillment of benchmark requirements is detailed, and the results show that our RescureService meets the requirements of a benchmark system in research.

At present, in different fields, people provide protection for online data migration through the way of project management to ensure the speed and efficiency of online migration. However, some problems may occur in the process of online data migration. In the development of contemporary sports, competitive sports, as the high-end stage of sports development, are constantly pursued by ordinary sports enthusiasts. Therefore, in the national fitness activities, how to combine the national fitness and competitive sports data to provide a more professional storage platform is a focus of research but also a problem to be solved in the process of online data migration. Because the data mining ID3 algorithm only supports querying and retrieving RowKey indexes, it does not support non-RowKey column indexing. Therefore, if you want to query non-RowKey indexes, the data mining ID3 algorithm will search the form in the overall scan, but the performance of this method is low. In order to improve the query speed of non-RowKey columns, this paper designs a secondary index function based on HBase. The sports competition action system can retrieve data from the secondary index of the query state, to avoid scanning the whole world and improve the search speed. In this paper, ID3 algorithm is used to combine national fitness and competitive sports data, which provides a guarantee for the migration of competitive sports data in the national fitness system.","2022-09-16","2025-10-27 09:37:21","2025-10-27 09:37:21","2025-10-22 15:24:00","1-11","","","2022","","Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","Sharma, Kapil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, this study proposes an efficiency analysis framework based on queuing models to analyze the efficiency difference of breaking down traditional large services into n microservices. For generalization, this study considers different service time distributions (e.g. exponential distribution of service time and fixed service time) and explores the system efficiency in the worst-case and best-case scenarios through queuing models (i.e. M/M/1 queuing model and M/D/1 queuing model). In each experiment, it was shown that the total time required for the original large service was higher than that required for breaking it down into multiple microservices, so breaking it down into multiple microservices can improve system efficiency. It can also be observed that in the best-case scenario, the improvement effect becomes more significant with an increase in arrival rate. However, in the worst-case scenario, only slight improvement was achieved. This study found that breaking down into multiple microservices can effectively improve system efficiency and proved that when the computation time of the large service is evenly distributed among multiple microservices, the best improvement effect can be achieved. Therefore, this study's findings can serve as a reference guide for future development of microservice architecture.","2023-12-14","2025-10-27 09:37:21","2025-10-27 09:37:21","2025-10-22 15:24:31","1-5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","","","","","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Software Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To offload workloads from user devices to edge servers with low latency, packets must be forwarded with low latency on a general-purpose server, and performance-oriented methods are widely used at the expense of higher power consumption, including a busy-polling method in receiving packets, such as the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK). However, in today’s large-scale services with many servers, even a slight increase in power consumption on each server results in wasting tremendous power. In this paper, we design and implement a packet-processing system on a general-purpose server that can achieve power saving while maintaining low latency. To avoid wasting power caused by busy polling, a receiving thread in the proposed system can sleep when no packet arrives and be woken up without delays by a hardware interrupt context of packet incoming. In addition, to enhance the power-saving effect of sleep, we design and implement a CPU idle control method that enables CPU cores used by receiving threads to enter an appropriate C-state in accordance with traffic load. We evaluate the proposed system in an environment that simulates a virtualized Radio Access Network (vRAN) system, which has strict latency requirements of network processing on a general-purpose server. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed system can reduce power consumption compared with a busy-polling system and the average latency degradation was only a few microseconds.","2025-04-03","2025-10-27 09:37:21","2025-10-27 09:37:21","2025-10-22 15:26:23","","","","","","Ann.

In this survey, we comprehensive examine the intersection of distributed intelligence and model optimization within edge-cloud environments, providing a structured tutorial on fundamental architectures, enabling technologies, and emerging applications. Additionally, we systematically analyze model optimization approaches, including compression, adaptation, and neural architecture search, alongside AI-driven resource management strategies that balance performance, energy efficiency, and latency requirements. We further explore critical aspects of privacy protection and security enhancement within ECCC systems and examines practical deployments through diverse applications, spanning autonomous driving, healthcare, and industrial automation. Performance analysis and benchmarking techniques are also thoroughly explored to establish evaluation standards for these complex systems. Furthermore, the review identifies critical research directions including LLMs deployment, 6G integration, neuromorphic computing, and quantum computing, offering a roadmap for addressing persistent challenges in heterogeneity management, real-time processing, and scalability.

The scheduling problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Process, where policy and value networks are jointly optimized to enable fine-grained resource allocation under varying load conditions. The method incorporates an asynchronous multi-threaded learning mechanism, allowing multiple agents to perform parallel sampling and synchronize updates to the global network parameters. This design improves both policy convergence efficiency and model stability. In the experimental section, a real-world dataset is used to construct a scheduling scenario. The proposed method is compared with several typical approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, including task delay, scheduling success rate, resource utilization, and convergence speed. The results show that the proposed method delivers high scheduling performance and system stability in multi-task concurrent environments. It effectively alleviates the resource allocation bottlenecks faced by traditional methods under heavy load, demonstrating its practical value for intelligent scheduling in microservice systems.","2025-05-01","2025-10-27 09:37:21","2025-10-27 09:37:21","2025-10-22 15:28:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In dense areas with many active RAN nodes, compute resources are engineered to support potentially hundreds of xApps monitoring and controlling the RAN to achieve operator's intents. However, such resources might become underutilized during low-traffic periods, where most cells are sleeping and, given the reduced RAN complexity, only a few xApps are needed for its control. In this paper, we propose CORMO-RAN, a data-driven orchestrator that dynamically activates compute nodes based on xApp load to save energy, and performs lossless migration of xApps from nodes to be turned off to active ones while ensuring xApp availability during migration. CORMO-RAN tackles the trade-off among service availability, scalability, and energy consumption while (i) preserving xApps' internal state to prevent RAN performance degradation during migration; (ii) accounting for xApp diversity in state size and timing constraints; and (iii) implementing several migration strategies and providing guidelines on best strategies to use based on resource availability and requirements. We prototype CORMO-RAN as an rApp, and experimentally evaluate it on an O-RAN private 5G testbed hosted on a Red Hat OpenShift cluster with commercial radio units. Results demonstrate that CORMO-RAN is effective in minimizing energy consumption of the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) cluster, yielding up to 64% energy saving when compared to existing approaches.","2025-06-24","2025-10-27 09:37:21","2025-10-27 09:37:21","2025-10-22 15:28:41","","","","","","","CORMO-RAN","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The compute continuum emerges as a promising solution, enabling flexible deployment of microservices across distributed, heterogeneous domains. However, this paradigm also requires a novel approach to resource allocation and service placement, as traditional centralized solutions struggle to scale effectively, suffer from latency bottlenecks, and introduce single points of failure. In this paper, we present DREAMS, a decentralized framework that optimizes microservice placement decisions collaboratively across different computational domains. At its core, DREAMS introduces agents that operate autonomously within each domain while coordinating globally through a Raft-based consensus algorithm and cost-benefit voting. This decentralized architecture enables responsive, privacy-preserving, and fault-tolerant coordination, making it particularly suitable given the growing prevalence of multi-stakeholder scenarios across the compute continuum. In particular, within modern manufacturing environments, DREAMS achieves globally optimized service placements while maintaining high fault tolerance. Further evaluations demonstrate that key coordination operations, such as Local Domain Manager (LDM) registration and migration voting, scale sub-linearly with the number of domains, confirming the efficiency and scalability of our proposal.","2025-09-09","2025-10-27 09:37:22","2025-10-27 09:37:22","2025-10-22 15:28:47","","","","","","","DREAMS","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is important to maintain stable control plane performance by load balancing strategies. To address the issue of controller load balancing in software‐defined Internet of Things (SD‐IoT), and meet the energy consumption requirements of nodes in the IoT during the adjustment process, a load balancing algorithm based on multi‐agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) is proposed. This approach models two critical factors: load difference and migration cost, and constructs a load balancing optimization problem based on these two factors. Subsequently, considering the dynamic changes in the state of the SD‐IoT, the load balancing problem is formulated as a Markov game process, and an algorithm is designed based on MADRL to solve this problem. Finally, the algorithm is validated based on real‐world topology, and a comparison is conducted from multiple perspectives including delay, load difference, energy consumption, and migration cost, demonstrating the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed algorithm.","2025-01","2025-10-27 09:37:22","2025-10-27 09:37:22","2025-10-22 15:29:31","8880533","","1","2025","","Journal of Computer Networks and Communications","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","Pau, Giovanni","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It provides attractive features, such as an on-demand model, scalability enhancement, and management cost reduction. However, cloud computing systems continue to face problems such as hardware failures, overloads caused by unexpected workloads, or the waste of energy due to inefficient resource utilization, which all result in resource shortages and application issues such as delays or saturation. A paradigm, the brownout, has been applied to handle these issues by adaptively activating or deactivating optional parts of applications or services to manage resource usage in cloud computing system. Brownout has successfully shown that it can avoid overloads due to changes in workload and achieve better load balancing and energy saving effects. This article proposes a taxonomy of the brownout approach for managing resources and applications adaptively in cloud computing systems and carries out a comprehensive survey. It identifies open challenges and offers future research directions.","2020-01-31","2025-10-27 09:37:22","2025-10-27 09:37:22","2025-10-22 15:30:11","1-27","","1","52","","ACM Comput.

Finding cloud management policies that adapt the system to the load is not straightforward, and we consider here that virtual machines are turned on and off depending on queue load thresholds. We want to compute the optimal threshold values that minimize consumption costs and penalty costs (when performance requirements are not met). To solve this problem, we propose several optimisation methods, based on two different mathematical approaches. The first one is based on queueing theory and uses local search heuristics coupled with the stationary distributions of Markov chains. The second approach tackles the problem using Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which we assume that the policy is of a special multi-threshold type called hysteresis. We improve the heuristics of the former approach with the aggregation of Markov chains and queues approximation techniques. We assess the benefit of threshold-aware algorithms for solving MDPs. Then we carry out theoretical analyzes of the two approaches. We also compare them numerically and we show that all of the presented MDP algorithms strongly outperform the local search heuristics. Finally, we propose a cost model for a real scenario of a cloud system to apply our optimisation algorithms and to show their practical relevance. The major scientific contribution of the article is a set of fast (almost in real time) load-based threshold computation methods that can be used by a cloud provider to optimize its financial costs.","2023-12-31","2025-10-27 09:37:22","2025-10-27 09:37:22","2025-10-22 15:30:23","1-31","","4","8","","ACM Trans.

It should be noted that one of the prominent factors in resource management is accurate traffic prediction based on a few data points and within a short time period. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is a suitable model to predict traffic in short time periods. However, it requires a massive amount of historical data to achieve accurate results. On the other hand, the fuzzy regression model is adequate for prediction using less historical data. Aforementioned by these considerations, in this paper, a combination of ARIMA and fuzzy regression called fuzzy autoregressive integrated moving average (FARIMA) is used to forecast traffic in cloud computing. Besides, we adopt the FARIMA model by using the sliding window, called SOFA, concept to determine models with higher prediction accuracy. Accuracy comparison of these models based on the root means square error and coefficient of determination demonstrates that SOFA is about 5.4 and 0.009, respectively, which is the superior model for traffic prediction.","2022-03","2025-10-27 09:37:22","2025-10-27 09:37:22","2025-10-22 15:30:25","e3731","","3","33","","Trans Emerging Tel Tech","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Geo distributed cloud data centers act as a backbone for providing fundamental infrastructure for cloud services delivery. Conversely, their high growing energy consumption rate is the major problem to be addressed. Cloud providers are in a hunger to identify different solutions to tackle energy management and carbon emission. In this work, a multi-cloud environment is modeled as geographically distributed data centers with varying solar power generation corresponding to its location, electricity price, carbon emission, and carbon tax. The energy management of the workload allocation algorithm is strongly dependent on the nature of the application considered. The task deadline and brownout information is used to bring in variation in task types. The renewable energy-aware workload allocation algorithm adaptive to task nature is proposed with migration policy to explore its impact on carbon emission, total energy cost, brown and renewable power consumption.","2021-11-17","2025-10-27 09:37:22","2025-10-27 09:37:22","2025-10-22 15:31:07","5677-5689","","5","41","","Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose a FaaS orchestration framework based on a cloud‐agnostic approach for application and data interoperability. The framework's performance is evaluated on the web application of a student attendance system for online learning. The test system comprises 300 records from 50 students across five courses. Through optional file elimination, entry recognition, optional function generation, and function‐level rewriting, the proposed orchestration framework suitably manages the storage of the student attendance records. The framework notably contributes to the student attendance web application by ensuring scalable, reliable, and efficient operations. Various evaluation measures confirm the effectiveness of the orchestration framework. These measures include cold/warm‐start execution time, cold/warm‐start memory usage, and zip execution time. An empirical analysis reveals that our framework reduces the execution time by 2 s –15 s and memory usage by 1MB–3 MB for the evaluated application.","2025-04","2025-10-27 09:37:22","2025-10-27 09:37:22","2025-10-22 15:36:07","312-325","","2","47","","ETRI Journal","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
