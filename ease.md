Title:
Energy Consumption of Monoliths and Microservices Applications: a Comparative Analysis

Abstract:
As energy demands rise and sustainability becomes critical, Information and Communication Technology's energy footprint is increasingly monitored. In this context, software architecture development models may play a significant role in determining a system's energy consumption.

This study presents a comparative analysis of monolith architectures versus microservice functionally equivalent applications, evaluating their energy consumption. To this purpose, we implemented the cohort protocol to create a controlled experimental environment. Through 30 test iterations across three representative use cases for each version of the applications, our findings demonstrate that microservices architecture \textcolor{black}{can potentially} outperform monolithic architecture in lowering energy consumption.

Title:
Sustainable Software Design: Quantifying Energy Differences Between Architectural Styles

Abstract:
With growing energy demands and sustainability concerns, the energy footprint of Information and Communication Technology is growing rapidly. Software architecture choices can significantly impact a system's energy consumption. This research examines the energy consumption patterns of two fundamental architectural styles - monolithic and microservices architectures.

Through a controlled experimental study, this research aims to compare the energy consumption of a functionallty equilivant open-source web application. The empirical evaluation suggests that the adoption of microservices architecture can reduce energy consumption by 5.78% compared to monolithic architecture.

<!-- results indicate that microservice architectures may outpreform advantages in energy efficiency compared to their monolithic counterparts under specific operational conditions. -->

<!-- Our experiments ecompassed three representative use cases for each architecture, with data collected multiple test iterations and .  -->
